# The Manhattan Project Breakthrough

## "MOMENTUM" in History

On December 2, 1942, beneath the squash courts at the University of Chicago, the Manhattan Project reached its moment of maximum potential. After years of theoretical work and careful preparation, Enrico Fermi and his team were about to achieve the first self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction. The experiment's success would unleash unprecedented power, marking humanity's entry into the atomic age. As the neutron-absorbing control rods were slowly withdrawn from the pile of uranium and graphite, the clicking of Geiger counters accelerated, indicating the approaching critical mass. The moment was so charged with potential that Fermi maintained absolute calm, carefully monitoring each step while other scientists grew increasingly excited. When the reaction became self-sustaining, Fermi waited another twenty-eight minutes, studying the controlled reaction, before ordering the shutdown. Eugene Wigner marked the moment by passing around a bottle of Chianti, yet everyone present understood that this peak of scientific achievement also represented a terrifying new responsibility. This moment of breakthrough exemplified the hexagram's warning about managing great power wisely - the same energy that could create could also destroy.
