# Gandhi's Salt March

## "PENETRATION" in History

On March 12, 1930, Mahatma Gandhi began a seemingly simple act of protest that would ultimately help bring down the British Empire in India. Rather than calling for violent rebellion or grand political actions, he chose to challenge British authority by walking 240 miles to the sea to make salt. The British Salt Act prohibited Indians from collecting or selling salt, forcing them to buy the essential mineral from the British at a heavily taxed price. Gandhi's march demonstrated the power of gentle but persistent influence - each step forward gathered more followers, each day brought more attention to the cause. The British initially dismissed the action as trivial, but as Gandhi walked, the protest penetrated deeper into the national consciousness. By the time he reached the sea on April 6, tens of thousands were following him, and the march had inspired acts of civil disobedience across India. When he finally picked up a small handful of salt from the ocean, breaking the law in the gentlest way possible, the act resonated throughout the Empire. The Salt March demonstrated how non-violent resistance, like a persistent wind, could wear away at even the strongest structures of power.
