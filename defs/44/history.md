# The Cuban Missile Crisis

## "ANTICIPATION" in History

On October 16, 1962, President John F. Kennedy was shown U-2 spy plane photographs revealing Soviet nuclear missile sites under construction in Cuba. What followed was thirteen days of unprecedented tension as the world teetered on the brink of nuclear war. The situation perfectly embodied the hexagram's qualities of anticipation and careful timing. Kennedy faced immense pressure to act immediately with military force, but chose instead to implement a naval "quarantine" while engaging in intense behind-the-scenes diplomacy. For nearly two weeks, U.S. and Soviet forces remained on highest alert, each side watching for any sign of aggression from the other. Nuclear armed B-52 bombers circled near Soviet airspace, Soviet submarines approached the U.S. blockade line, and the world held its breath. The tension reached its peak on October 27th when a U-2 was shot down over Cuba. Rather than retaliating, Kennedy chose to ignore the immediate provocation and instead focused on a wider diplomatic solution. His patience paid off when, on October 28th, Soviet Premier Khrushchev announced that the missiles would be withdrawn from Cuba, having secured a private commitment that the U.S. would later remove missiles from Turkey. This crisis demonstrated the hexagram's central theme of maintaining composure and judgment while energy builds to a critical point.
