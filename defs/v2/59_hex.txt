This hexagram lends qualities of resurrecting origins to the tholon of fulfillment and rebirth, signifying a journey homewards to the source. It beholds the perspective of metamorphosis from inflexible patterns into a realm filled with fluid potentialities. Its essence embodies dispersion, transformation, and liberation, while it disrupts barriers, and creates a fluid movement, one that is indicative of manifestation. Success is achieved through an unassuming yet relentless dissolution of barriers. Its energy flows downwards in a balanced descent. The challenge that must be surmounted is to maintain consistency amidst dissolution.
