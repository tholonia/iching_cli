In this award-winning, highly symbolic artwork, the choice of a dammed river as the object represents the hexagram "STAGNATION," embodying a necessary pause in early development, akin to the slowing flow of water amidst the construction of form and order. The surrealist style aligns with the abstract, yet deeply intuitive process of awareness shaping reality, challenging perceptions and encouraging deeper contemplation. Ink as a medium provides a stark clarity and permanence to the portrayal, mirroring the foundational structures and limitations inherent within Tholonic models of awareness. Although Edgar Degas is incorrectly attributed here, his renowned ability to capture movement and emotion subtly connects with the awareness and intention encapsulated in the Tholonic concept. Together, these elements work harmoniously, exploring the negotiation and balance between motion and stillness as awareness evolves through stages of development.
