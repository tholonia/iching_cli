# Leonardo's Apprenticeship: The Making of a Master

## "Authentic Expression" in History

In 1466, a fourteen-year-old Leonardo da Vinci began his apprenticeship in the workshop of Andrea del Verrocchio in Florence. The story of his transformation from apprentice to master perfectly embodies the journey of authentic expression through disciplined refinement.

Verrocchio's workshop was renowned for its exacting standards. Every apprentice began with the most basic tasks: grinding pigments, preparing panels, and mixing plaster. Young Leonardo spent years mastering these fundamental skills before being allowed to paint even the simplest elements of a composition. This grounding in craftsmanship would later enable his revolutionary artistic innovations.

The turning point in Leonardo's development came during his collaboration with Verrocchio on "The Baptism of Christ" (1472-1475). According to Vasari's account, when Leonardo painted one of the angels in the scene, his expression of grace and luminosity so far surpassed his master's work that Verrocchio vowed never to paint again. While this story may be apocryphal, the angel's face does display a remarkable fusion of technical mastery and spiritual radiance that marks Leonardo's emergence as an artist in his own right.

What makes this historical moment so relevant to the hexagram of Authentic Expression is how it demonstrates the relationship between disciplined study and genuine creativity. Leonardo's years of careful training didn't constrain his natural genius - instead, they provided the foundation that allowed his unique vision to shine forth. His technical skill became the vehicle for expressing deeper truths about nature and human experience, exemplifying how authentic expression emerges through the marriage of inner truth with cultivated form.
