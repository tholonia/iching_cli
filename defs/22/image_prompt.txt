"A Symbolist artwork representing I Ching hexagram 22: Authentic Expression. The scene depicts a majestic mountain at twilight, with a radiant fire glowing at its summit. The mountain symbolizes inner strength and truth, while the fire at its peak represents the authentic self radiating outward, illuminating the landscape below. The light from the fire is warm and serene, casting subtle glows on the mountainside, and revealing intricate details of rocks, trees, and paths that wind up the mountain. In the foreground, a skilled artist stands, carefully chiseling a sculpture that appears to emerge naturally from the rock, reflecting the beauty of genuine creation. The overall atmosphere is one of mindful cultivation and refined expression, where inner authenticity meets artistic form."

Style: Symbolism, focusing on conveying the deeper, mystical essence of inner truth and mindful refinement.
Medium: Oil Paint, to capture the rich texture, glowing warmth, and intricate details of the mountain and fire.
Inspired by: Gustav Klimt, whose works combine detailed, symbolic elements with a radiant, luminous quality that emphasizes both substance and beauty.
