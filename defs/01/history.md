# Tesla's Vision of Wireless Power

## "Creation" in History

In 1899, Nikola Tesla established his Colorado Springs laboratory to prove that Earth itself could conduct electrical power. While others focused on incremental improvements to existing systems, Tesla envisioned creating an entirely new paradigm of global power distribution.

In his experimental station, Tesla generated artificial lightning bolts over a hundred feet long and illuminated light bulbs wirelessly at distances up to 25 miles. Each experiment built upon the last, leading to his ultimate vision - the Wardenclyffe Tower project, designed to transmit power and information wirelessly across the globe.

Though financial constraints prevented the tower's completion, Tesla's creative vision demonstrated unprecedented scope. He didn't just improve existing technology; he attempted to create an entirely new relationship between humanity and electricity. His Colorado Springs experiments proved that wireless power transmission was possible, laying groundwork for technologies we're still developing today.
