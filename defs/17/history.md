# Gandhi's Salt March: Leading Through Natural Alignment

## "Resonance" in History

In March 1930, when British colonial rule seemed unshakeable in India, Mahatma Gandhi initiated a movement that would demonstrate the extraordinary power of resonance in social change. Rather than confronting British authority directly, he chose to challenge the Salt Laws - regulations that prohibited Indians from collecting or selling salt, forcing them to buy it from British monopolies.

Gandhi's genius lay not in the magnitude of his opposition but in its simplicity and natural resonance with daily life. Salt was essential to everyone, rich and poor alike. By choosing to make salt from seawater - a basic right denied to all Indians - Gandhi created an action that naturally resonated with the entire population.

The march began with just 78 followers walking from Sabarmati Ashram to the coastal village of Dandi. But as they walked, something remarkable happened. The action created what historians would later call a "cascade of participation." People from all walks of life, seeing the simple truth of the protest, began making salt in their own communities. The British found themselves unable to stop an action that was simultaneously everywhere and nowhere.

The brilliance of the campaign lay in how it allowed people to participate naturally, each in their own way. Unlike previous protests that required direct confrontation, the salt satyagraha invited people to simply exercise a natural right. The movement spread not through organization but through resonance, as people recognized their own struggle in Gandhi's simple act.

By the time Gandhi reached the sea and picked up a handful of salt, the entire nation had been transformed. The British authorities found themselves facing not an organization they could suppress, but a natural movement that flowed like water around their attempts at control. This demonstration of peaceful resonance would become a model for social movements worldwide.
