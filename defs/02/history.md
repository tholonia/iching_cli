# Darwin's Silent Revolution

## "Receptivity" in History

In 1858, Charles Darwin received a manuscript from Alfred Russel Wallace that outlined the exact theory of evolution by natural selection that Darwin had been developing for twenty years. Rather than defending his priority or dismissing Wallace's insights, Darwin demonstrated remarkable receptivity. He arranged for both their papers to be presented jointly to the Linnean Society, giving Wallace full credit as co-discoverer.

Darwin's receptive approach extended to his scientific method. Unlike his contemporaries who imposed theories on nature, Darwin spent decades simply observing and collecting data. His notebooks show a mind open to evidence that often contradicted his initial assumptions. He let his theory emerge from observations rather than forcing facts to fit preconceptions.

This receptive approach proved crucial to his insights. By remaining open to nature's patterns rather than imposing his own, he was able to perceive the subtle workings of natural selection that others had missed. His willingness to consider every piece of evidence, even those that challenged his ideas, led to a more robust theory.
