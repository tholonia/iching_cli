# Stagnation

## Core Meaning
The state of blockage that arises when expansion meets resistance. Like heaven's energy blocked by earth, this represents the temporary cessation of flow that precedes necessary transformation.

## Structure
**King Wen Sequence**: 12
**King Wen Title**: P'i (Standstill)
**Binary Sequence**: 56 (111000)
**Above**: Kun (Earth, Receptivity, Field)
**Below**: Qian (Heaven, Creative Force, Dynamic)
**Perspective**: Creative force meeting resistance, necessitating reassessment

## Key Attributes
**Nature**: Obstructing
**Action**: Strategic withdrawal
**Success through**: Understanding and accepting temporary limitations
**Image**: Heaven's energy blocked by earth; A dammed river
**Challenge**: Maintaining patience while seeking new pathways

## Lines in Transition
**Line 6**: *Release Point*: The blockage begins to clear; *Prepare for renewal*
**Line 5**: *Strategic Patience*: Understanding when to wait; *Conserve energy wisely*
**Line 4**: *Hidden Movement*: Internal preparation during external stillness; *Build strength quietly*
**Line 3**: *Mounting Pressure*: Peak of stagnation; *Avoid premature action*
**Line 2**: *Inner Work*: Developing resources during delay; *Use time constructively*
**Line 1**: *Initial Recognition*: Awareness of growing resistance; *Accept current limitations*

## Tholonic Analysis
### Negotiation
The hexagram represents the negotiation between containing forces (Kun/Earth) and expansive energy (Qian/Heaven). This creates a dynamic tension between movement and resistance, like pressure building in a closed system.

### Limitation
Structure is provided by the earth above, indicating complete but temporary containment. The heaven below suggests that creative force remains active but currently constrained.

### Contribution
This pattern contributes to evolution by demonstrating how periods of apparent stagnation can lead to transformation. It shows how resistance can build pressure for breakthrough.

### Significance in the Thologram
In the tholonic system, this hexagram represents the point where energy meets maximum resistance, creating potential for transformation. It demonstrates how consciousness can work with obstruction to create new pathways.

## No Moving Lines
When no lines are changing, focus on patient endurance and internal development. Success comes through accepting current limitations while preparing for future movement.

## All Moving Lines
A complete transformation in how obstruction is experienced is indicated. Old patterns of resistance must give way to new forms of flow. Ensure that patience remains while embracing change.
