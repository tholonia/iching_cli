# The Great Lisbon Earthquake

## "DISRUPTION" in History

On All Saints' Day, November 1, 1755, Lisbon, Portugal - one of Europe's most prosperous and magnificent cities - was enjoying a peaceful religious holiday when disaster struck without warning. At approximately 9:40 AM, a massive earthquake estimated at magnitude 9.0 shook the city for up to six minutes, collapsing thousands of buildings and killing many instantly. Those who survived the initial quake fled to the city's waterfront, only to face a second shock: a massive tsunami that swept away the harbor and everyone in it. The third blow came from hundreds of fires that broke out across the city, burning uncontrolled for five days. This triple catastrophe killed up to 50,000 people and destroyed 85% of Lisbon's buildings, including nearly all the city's churches, which were packed for the holiday. The disaster shook not just buildings but the philosophical foundations of European thought. Voltaire used it as the centerpiece of "Candide," challenging the prevailing optimistic philosophy that "all is for the best in this best of all possible worlds." The event transformed European thought about natural disasters, leading to the first systematic study of seismology and the birth of modern earthquake engineering. It also marked the first large-scale, state-sponsored disaster response, as Portugal's Prime Minister Pombal organized a rapid and systematic recovery effort that would become a model for future disaster management.
