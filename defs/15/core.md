# Equilibrium

## Core Meaning
The state of dynamic balance achieved through conscious moderation. Like a mountain resting naturally on earth, this represents stability achieved through alignment with fundamental principles.

## Structure
**King Wen Sequence**: 15
**King Wen Title**: Ch'ien (Modesty)

## Lines in Transition
**Line 6**: *Complete Balance*: Perfect equilibrium achieved naturally; *Maintain without forcing*
**Line 5**: *Wise Moderation*: Understanding natural limits; *Lead by example*
**Line 4**: *Dynamic Stability*: Balance maintained through movement; *Adjust as needed*
**Line 3**: *Tested Harmony*: Balance under pressure; *Stay centered in difficulty*
**Line 2**: *Inner Balance*: Foundation of personal equilibrium; *Build from center*
**Line 1**: *Natural Order*: Beginning of balanced movement; *Start with proper measure*

## Tholonic Analysis
### Negotiation
The hexagram represents the negotiation between stable restraint (Gen/Mountain) and receptive foundation (Kun/Earth). This creates a dynamic balance between containing and yielding, like a natural system finding its optimal state.

### Limitation
Structure is provided by the mountain above, indicating that stability must be actively maintained. The earth below suggests that balance must be grounded in fundamental reality.

### Contribution
This pattern contributes to evolution by demonstrating how systems achieve sustainable equilibrium. It shows how conscious moderation creates lasting stability.

### Significance in the Thologram
In the tholonic system, this hexagram represents the point where consciousness creates sustainable order through balanced interaction. It demonstrates how awareness can maintain harmony through proper measure.

## No Moving Lines
When no lines are changing, focus on maintaining current equilibrium. Success comes through steady adherence to balanced principles rather than dramatic adjustments.

## All Moving Lines
A complete transformation in how balance is maintained is indicated. Old forms of stability must give way to new forms of equilibrium. Ensure that balance remains dynamic while embracing change.
