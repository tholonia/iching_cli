        "description": "Dissolution or deterioration represents the natural process of decay and dissolution that precedes renewal. Like a mountain eroding or a house falling into disrepair, all structures eventually break down. This deterioration is not a catastrophe but a natural phase that clears the way for new growth.",

            "limitation": "The limitations here are defined by natural law - all things must eventually break down. The hexagram shows how this process typically progresses from bottom to top, like a building losing its foundation first.",
            "contribution": "This hexagram contributes understanding of natural cycles of decay and renewal. It teaches acceptance of impermanence and the wisdom of knowing when to let go rather than resist inevitable change.",
            "significance_in_thologram": "In the thologram, this hexagram represents the necessary phase of dissolution that precedes new creation. It is positioned at a critical transition point where existing structures must break down to allow new forms to emerge."

        "no_moving_lines": "When no lines are moving, the situation indicates a clear phase of deterioration that must simply be accepted and managed wisely. The focus should be on preserving what is valuable while letting go of what cannot be saved. This is not a time for new initiatives but for careful stewardship of remaining resources.",
        "all_moving_lines": "When all lines are moving, the deterioration is complete and comprehensive. Every aspect of the situation is in flux. This represents a total transformation where nothing of the old structure will remain intact. While potentially alarming, this total dissolution also creates space for entirely new beginnings."
