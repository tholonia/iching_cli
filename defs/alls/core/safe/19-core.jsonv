            "Negotiation": "The hexagram represents the negotiation between grounding receptivity (Kun/Earth) and expressive joy (Dui/Lake). This creates a dynamic balance between containing form and allowing expansion, like a garden bed supporting new growth.",
            "Limitation": "Structure is provided by the earth above, suggesting that emergence must occur within defined contexts and boundaries. The lake below indicates that growth, while joyful and expansive, must remain grounded in reality.",
