# ä·½ Incremental Progress

From small actions, great achievements emerge. Success comes through patient attention to detail and steady advancement, like compound interest accumulating over time.

**King Wen Sequence**: 62
**King Wen Title**: Hsiao Kuo (Small Exceeding/Preponderance of the Small)
**Binary Sequence**: 12 (001100)
**Above**: Thunder - Movement, Initiative
**Below**: Mountain - Stillness, Meditation
**Perspective**: Small actions creating momentum
**Nature**: Methodical
**Action**: Accumulation through repetition
**Success through**: Consistent, manageable steps
**Image**: A bird flying incrementally higher with each wingbeat
**Challenge**: Maintaining patience during slow progress

## Lines in Transition  
**Line 6**: *Overreach*: Going too far ruins previous gains; *Know when to stop*
**Line 5**: *Measured Response*: Meeting challenges proportionally; *Stay balanced*
**Line 4**: *Adaptation*: Adjusting approach as needed; *Remain flexible*
**Line 3**: *Caution*: Avoiding reckless advancement; *Consider consequences*
**Line 2**: *Foundation*: Building from stable base; *Establish fundamentals*
**Line 1**: *Beginning*: Starting with small steps; *Start where you are*

## Tholonic Analysis
**Negotiation**: Balance between movement and stillness creates sustainable progress. Thunder above Mountain shows controlled release of energy. Represents the dance between action and restraint.

**Limitation**: Small actions have natural boundaries that prevent overextension. The mountain base provides structure while thunder provides measured bursts of energy. Defines achievable scope.

**Contribution**: Demonstrates how incremental change leads to transformation. Like water carved the Grand Canyon, small persistent actions reshape reality. Returns to source through accumulated effects.

**Significance in the Thologram**: Represents how systemic change occurs through granular interactions. Functions as a model for sustainable growth. Important for understanding emergence from simple patterns.

**No Moving Lines**: Current approach is well-calibrated - continue steady progress without dramatic changes. Maintain current rhythm. Trust the process.
**All Moving Lines**: Complete transformation through accumulation of small changes. Like compound interest reaching critical mass. Time to harvest accumulated gains.
