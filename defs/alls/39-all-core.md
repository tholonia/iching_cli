## Tholonic Analysis
**Negotiation**: Balance between action and restraint creates effective strategy. Like water meeting stone, resistance generates creative solutions. Shows how obstacles become opportunities through proper negotiation.

**Limitation**: Obstacles define potential pathways and reveal hidden strengths. Limitations force innovation and efficiency. Creates structure through necessary adaptation.

**Contribution**: Returns complexity to simplicity through strategic problem-solving. Like water wearing down stone, persistence contributes to eventual breakthrough. Demonstrates how resistance generates growth.

**Significance in the Thologram**: Represents the dynamic between Definition (obstacle) and Contribution (solution). Shows how resistance shapes development. Essential for evolution through challenge.

**No Moving Lines**: Current obstacles require patient strategy and careful planning. Stable resistance enables methodical progress. Maintain steady approach while building resources.

**All Moving Lines**: Complete transformation through full strategic adaptation. All approaches shift simultaneously, revealing new pathways. Navigate change through comprehensive strategy.
