# ä·– Dissolution

Dissolution or deterioration represents the natural process of decay and dissolution that precedes renewal. Like a mountain eroding or a house falling into disrepair, all structures eventually break down. This deterioration is not a catastrophe but a natural phase that clears the way for new growth.


**King Wen Sequence**: 23
**King Wen Title**: Po (Splitting Apart)
**Binary Sequence**: 32 (100000)
**Above**: Gen (Mountain) - Stillness, Boundaries
**Below**: Kun (Earth) - Receptivity, Submission
**Perspective**: The inevitable dissolution of structures that have reached their limit of sustainability
**Nature**: Deterioration and decay
**Action**: Accept and manage decline
**Success through**: Understanding cycles, prepared withdrawal
**Image**: A house collapsing from erosion at its base; a mountain crumbling
**Challenge**: Maintaining dignity and order during decline

## Lines in Transition
**Line 6**: *Final Collapse*: The deterioration completes its course; *Accept the inevitable end*
**Line 5**: *Preservation*: Finding ways to salvage what is valuable; *Save what can be saved*
**Line 4**: *Gradual Decline*: The structure weakens from within; *Address internal weaknesses*
**Line 3**: *Breaking Point*: The decay becomes evident; *Prepare for significant changes*
**Line 2**: *Supporting*: The foundation begins to weaken; *Shore up basic foundations*
**Line 1**: *Beginning of Decay*: First signs of deterioration appear; *Notice early warning signs*

## Tholonic Analysis
**Negotiation**: This hexagram represents the negotiation between structure and entropy. The mountain (Gen) represents established order while the earth (Kun) below represents the forces of dissolution. The interaction between these forces is inevitable and natural.

**Limitation**: The limitations here are defined by natural law - all things must eventually break down. The hexagram shows how this process typically progresses from bottom to top, like a building losing its foundation first.

**Contribution**: This hexagram contributes understanding of natural cycles of decay and renewal. It teaches acceptance of impermanence and the wisdom of knowing when to let go rather than resist inevitable change.

**Significance in the Thologram**: In the thologram, this hexagram represents the necessary phase of dissolution that precedes new creation. It is positioned at a critical transition point where existing structures must break down to allow new forms to emerge.

**No Moving Lines**: When no lines are moving, the situation indicates a clear phase of deterioration that must simply be accepted and managed wisely. The focus should be on preserving what is valuable while letting go of what cannot be saved. This is not a time for new initiatives but for careful stewardship of remaining resources.

**All Moving Lines**: When all lines are moving, the deterioration is complete and comprehensive. Every aspect of the situation is in flux. This represents a total transformation where nothing of the old structure will remain intact. While potentially alarming, this total dissolution also creates space for entirely new beginnings.
