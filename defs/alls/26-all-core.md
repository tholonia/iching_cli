The process of accumulating power through discipline. Like a mountain containing powerful forces, this represents the development of potential through restraint.

## Tholonic Analysis
**Negotiation**: The hexagram represents the negotiation between containing stillness (Gen/Mountain) and creative force (Qian/Heaven). This creates powerful development through discipline.

**Limitation**: Structure is provided by mountain above, indicating that power must be contained. Heaven below suggests that energy seeks expression through proper channels.

**Contribution**: This pattern contributes to evolution by showing how restraint builds power. It demonstrates how consciousness develops through disciplined practice.

**Significance in the Thologram**: In the tholonic system, this hexagram represents where awareness cultivates potential. It shows how consciousness can develop through controlled accumulation.

**No Moving Lines**: When no lines are changing, focus on steady development. Success comes through patient cultivation rather than forced growth.

**All Moving Lines**: A complete transformation in how power is developed is indicated. Old patterns of cultivation must give way to new forms of practice. Ensure discipline remains while embracing change.
