# ไทธ Penetration

The gentle but persistent influence that creates lasting change. Like wind shaping mountains or water wearing through stone, this represents the power of subtle, continuous action to transform even the most resistant situations.


**King Wen Sequence**: 57

## Lines in Transition
**Line 6**: *Culmination*: Complete penetration achieved; *Accept results*
**Line 5**: *Integration*: Persistence brings regret; *Know when to stop*
**Line 4**: *Emergence*: Remorse disappears; *Trust the process*
**Line 3**: *Deployment*: Repeated efforts succeed; *Stay consistent*
**Line 2**: *Definition*: Hidden influence works best; *Act subtly*
**Line 1**: *Inception*: Advance and retreat; *Start gently*

## Tholonic Analysis
**Negotiation**: The hexagram represents the balance between influence and resistance. The doubled wind shows how persistent gentle force can overcome obstacles, demonstrating that subtle influence can be more effective than direct confrontation.

**Limitation**: The structure defines boundaries between effective and ineffective influence. It establishes how change must occur through natural patterns, showing that force must align with existing flows.

**Contribution**: This configuration contributes to systemic evolution by demonstrating how subtle persistence creates lasting change. It shows how gentle but continuous influence shapes reality.

**Significance in the Thologram**: Represents the critical role of persistent subtle influence. Functions as a model for how awareness shapes circumstances through consistent action. Important in understanding how systems evolve through gradual transformation.

**No Moving Lines**: The situation calls for maintaining gentle persistence. Continue subtle influence while respecting natural patterns. Success comes through steady, unforced progress.

**All Moving Lines**: Complete transformation through subtle influence is occurring. All aspects of the situation are responding to gentle pressure. The penetration will create fundamental change, requiring careful attention to maintaining appropriate force.
