# BOUNDARIES

## Core Meaning
The establishment and maintenance of appropriate limits. Like a river contained by its banks or a society guided by ethical principles, this represents the power of conscious limitation to create meaningful structure and sustainable progress.

## Structure
**King Wen Sequence**: 60
**King Wen Title**: Jie/Limitation
**Binary Sequence**: 19 (010011)
**Above**: Kan (Water/Danger)
**Below**: Dui (Lake/Joy)
**Perspective**: Finding freedom through appropriate constraints

## Key Attributes
**Nature**: Containing, defining, structuring
**Action**: Setting limits, establishing order
**Success through**: Clear definition and consistent application
**Image**: Water over lake - establishing natural levels
**Challenge**: Maintaining flexibility within structure

## Lines in Transition
**Line 6**: *Culmination*: Bitter limitation; *Avoid extremes*
**Line 5**: *Integration*: Sweet limitation; *Find balance*
**Line 4**: *Emergence*: Contented limitation; *Accept boundaries*
**Line 3**: *Deployment*: Anxious limitation; *Release tension*
**Line 2**: *Definition*: Balanced limitation; *Create structure*
**Line 1**: *Inception*: Initial boundaries set; *Start with clarity*

## Tholonic Analysis
### Negotiation
The hexagram represents the balance between freedom and constraint. The water above finds its natural level with the lake below, showing how proper boundaries create sustainable systems.

### Limitation
The structure defines boundaries between productive and restrictive limits. It establishes how constraints must serve growth, showing that true freedom requires appropriate structure.

### Contribution
This configuration contributes to systemic evolution by demonstrating how proper boundaries enable development. It shows how limitations create the context for meaningful progress.

### Significance in the Thologram
Represents the critical role of appropriate limitation in evolution. Functions as a model for how awareness develops through structured growth. Important in understanding how systems evolve through proper constraint.

## No Moving Lines
The situation calls for maintaining appropriate boundaries. Continue defining clear limits while ensuring they serve growth. Success comes through balanced constraint.

## All Moving Lines
Complete transformation of boundaries is occurring. All aspects of limitation are in flux. The restructuring will create fundamental change, requiring careful attention to maintaining appropriate constraints.
