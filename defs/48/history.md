# The Marshall Plan

## "RESTORATION" in History

In the aftermath of World War II, Europe lay in ruins. Its industrial base was destroyed, agricultural production had collapsed, and millions were homeless and starving. Into this crisis stepped U.S. Secretary of State George Marshall, who in 1947 proposed an unprecedented program of economic assistance to restore Europe's economic health. The Marshall Plan, as it came to be known, exemplified the hexagram's theme of restoration through careful, systematic nourishment of fundamental resources. Over four years, the United States provided $13 billion in aid (equivalent to about $140 billion today), but the program's genius lay not just in the amount of aid but in how it was administered. Rather than simply providing handouts, the Plan required European nations to work together to create their own recovery programs. They had to coordinate their industrial production, remove trade barriers, and modernize their business practices. Like an ancient well that serves an entire community, the Marshall Plan created sustainable infrastructure for ongoing renewal. The results were remarkable: by 1952, industrial production in Western Europe had increased by 35% compared to pre-war levels, agricultural production exceeded pre-war levels by 11%, and trade among European nations had expanded by 40%. More importantly, it laid the groundwork for the European Economic Community, which would eventually become the European Union.
