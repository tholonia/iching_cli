# Tesla's Moment of Illumination

## "Radiant Awareness" in History

In the summer of 1856, while walking in the Budapest City Park, Nikola Tesla experienced a transformative moment of clarity that would change the course of technological history. While reciting Goethe's "Faust" and watching the setting sun, he suddenly visualized his alternating current (AC) motor in complete detail - a revolutionary device that would harness the natural rotation of electromagnetic fields.

This wasn't merely a technical insight, but a moment of pure illuminated awareness where Tesla claimed he could see the motor working in perfect detail before his eyes. He even drew diagrams in the dirt with a stick to show his walking companion. The vision was so complete that when he finally built the motor years later, it worked exactly as he had seen it in that moment of clarity.

Tesla's insight exemplified the hexagram's theme of double illumination - both the technical brilliance of the AC motor's design and the clarity of consciousness that allowed him to perceive it fully formed. This moment of radiant awareness didn't just solve a technical problem; it revealed a fundamental pattern of nature that would transform how humanity harnessed electrical energy.
