# The Race for DNA's Structure

## "Conflict" in History

The 1950s race to discover DNA's structure demonstrates how productive conflict can drive breakthrough insights. The competition between Linus Pauling at Caltech and the team of Watson and Crick at Cambridge, with crucial work from Rosalind Franklin at King's College, created a dynamic tension that accelerated discovery.

Each group approached the problem differently. Pauling relied on model building and chemical intuition. Franklin meticulously gathered X-ray diffraction data. Watson and Crick synthesized available information and built physical models. Their competition spurred each to work harder and think more creatively.

The conflict reached its peak when Pauling proposed an incorrect triple-helix model. This galvanized Watson and Crick, who, drawing on Franklin's precise X-ray data (though controversially obtained), realized the double helix structure was correct. The competition had forced all parties to refine their methods and scrutinize their assumptions.

This scientific rivalry, despite its ethical complications regarding Franklin's work, exemplifies how conflict can drive progress when channeled through structured scientific inquiry. The competition ultimately produced one of science's greatest discoveries.
