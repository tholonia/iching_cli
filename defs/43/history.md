# The Storming of the Bastille

## "BREAKTHROUGH" in History

On July 14, 1789, the mounting tensions in Paris reached a critical point. The Bastille, a medieval fortress and prison, stood as a potent symbol of royal authority and oppression. For generations, its towering walls had cast long shadows over the city, housing political prisoners and storing massive quantities of gunpowder and ammunition that the revolutionaries desperately needed. That morning, a crowd of nearly 1,000 Parisians gathered outside its walls, their frustrations with the monarchy's abuses having reached a breaking point. The fortress was defended by 82 invalides (veteran soldiers) and 32 grenadiers, with 30 Swiss guards arriving as reinforcements. After hours of tense negotiations failed, the crowd's patience snapped. In a decisive moment, they surged forward, breaking through the outer wall. The fortress's governor, Bernard-Ren√© de Launay, initially resisted but ultimately surrendered to prevent further bloodshed. The storming of the Bastille marked a crucial breakthrough moment in the French Revolution, transforming simmering social tensions into decisive revolutionary action. Though only seven prisoners were found inside, the symbolic power of breaching this fortress catalyzed the revolution, marking the end of the absolute monarchy and the birth of modern France. This event perfectly embodies the hexagram's themes of breakthrough, where concentrated social pressure finally ruptures established boundaries, creating irreversible change.
