# The Fall of the Berlin Wall

## "DISSOLUTION" in History

On November 9, 1989, the Berlin Wall, the most potent symbol of the Cold War's rigid divisions, began to dissolve not through violence but through a cascade of misunderstandings and popular will. It began when East German government spokesman GÃ¼nter Schabowski mistakenly announced at a press conference that new refugee regulations would take effect "immediately," including free passage across the border. As this news spread through West German television, East Berliners began gathering at checkpoints, creating a peaceful but unstoppable pressure. The border guards, receiving no clear orders and unwilling to use force, began allowing people through. What had been the world's most notorious barrier started dissolving through the simple movement of people walking through it. In the following days, ordinary citizens began dismantling the wall piece by piece - a process they called "wall pecking" - transforming a barrier of separation into souvenirs of freedom. The rigid structure that had divided Europe for nearly thirty years dissolved not through military force but through the fluid power of human desire for connection.
