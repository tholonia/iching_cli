# The Long Walk of Harriet Tubman

## "TRANSITION" in History

Harriet Tubman's journeys on the Underground Railroad exemplify the hexagram's themes of purposeful wandering and maintaining direction through dangerous territory. After escaping slavery herself in 1849, Tubman made nineteen return trips to the South, guiding approximately seventy enslaved people to freedom. Her methods demonstrated a perfect balance of movement and stability - she developed consistent routes and safe houses while remaining flexible enough to avoid capture. Tubman learned to navigate by natural signs, using the North Star and moss on trees, while adapting to changing circumstances such as increased patrols or weather conditions. She never lost a passenger, earning her the nickname "Moses" for her ability to lead people through their own exodus. Her strength came not just from physical endurance but from maintaining absolute clarity of purpose while in constant motion. She had to be simultaneously visible to those who needed her help and invisible to those who would stop her. This period of her life, spanning approximately ten years, shows how transition, when guided by clear purpose, can become a powerful force for transformation.
