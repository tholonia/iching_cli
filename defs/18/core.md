## Tholonic Analysis
### Negotiation
The hexagram represents the negotiation between stable foundation (Gen/Mountain) and penetrating action (Sun/Wind). This creates a dynamic balance between maintaining structure while allowing necessary change, like renovation that preserves essential form.

### Limitation
Structure is provided by the mountain above, indicating that restoration must work within existing frameworks. The wind below suggests that change comes through persistent, gentle action rather than forceful intervention.

### Contribution
This pattern contributes to evolution by demonstrating how systems can be renewed without being destroyed. It shows how careful attention to fundamentals can restore harmony and function.

### Significance in the Thologram
In the tholonic system, this hexagram represents the point where consciousness actively repairs and renews existing structures. It demonstrates how awareness can heal and restore order through patient, penetrating work.

## No Moving Lines
When no lines are changing, focus on steady, methodical restoration work. Success comes through patient attention to fundamentals rather than quick fixes.

## All Moving Lines
A complete transformation in how restoration is approached is indicated. Old methods of repair must give way to new understanding. Ensure that renewal preserves what is essential while clearing what has decayed.
