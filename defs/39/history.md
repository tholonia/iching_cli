# The Fabius Strategy: Mastering Strategic Resistance

## "Strategic Resistance" in History

During the Second Punic War (218-201 BCE), Roman general Quintus Fabius Maximus faced an seemingly invincible Hannibal who had decimated Roman forces and struck fear throughout Italy. Rather than engage Hannibal directly as his predecessors had done disastrously, Fabius adopted an unprecedented strategy of strategic retreat and calculated harassment. Known as the "Delayer," he kept his army on high ground, shadowing Hannibal's forces while avoiding direct battles, instead targeting supply lines and isolated units. This strategy initially earned him fierce criticism from Rome's elite and his own officers, who saw it as cowardly. However, his approach gradually wore down Hannibal's army, depriving it of resources and allies while preserving Roman strength. Though Fabius faced intense political opposition, his strategy proved instrumental in Rome's eventual victory and became a military doctrine known as Fabian strategy, demonstrating how intelligent resistance can overcome seemingly insurmountable obstacles.
