An Expressionist painting representing I Ching hexagram 21: Breakthrough. The scene depicts a powerful lightning bolt piercing through a dark, stormy sky, illuminating the landscape below in vivid bursts of light. In the foreground, a sharp blade slices through a dense, entangled mass of vines, symbolizing the decisive intervention cutting through resistance. The colors are bold and contrastingâ€”deep blues and purples of the storm against the bright, electric yellows and whites of the lightning. The overall atmosphere conveys forceful clarity, determination, and the moment of breaking through obstacles. The brushstrokes are dynamic and intense, capturing the energy of the thunderstorm and the impact of the breakthrough."

Style: Expressionism, emphasizing the emotional intensity and power of decisive action, using vivid colors and dynamic forms.
Medium: Acrylic, to provide strong, vibrant colors and textural variation that conveys the energy and immediacy of the breakthrough.
Inspired by: Edvard Munch, known for his use of bold colors and dramatic, expressive lines to convey deep emotional states.
