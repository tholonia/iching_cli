# ENIAC: Difficult Beginnings of the Computer Age

## "Initiation" in History

In 1943, amidst World War II, engineers John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert began work on ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer), facing seemingly insurmountable challenges. With no precedent for electronic computing, every step required invention. The basic problem of reliable vacuum tubes alone seemed impossible â€“ the machine would need 18,000 of them to work perfectly in sync.

The team faced ridicule from skeptics who claimed electronic computing was impossible at such a scale. Each challenge demanded innovative solutions: new circuits had to be designed, novel programming methods developed, and cooling systems invented. The women programmers, including Jean Jennings and Betty Snyder, had to create entirely new mathematical methods as they went.

The project endured material shortages, technical setbacks, and constant skepticism. When finally unveiled in 1946, ENIAC occupied 1,800 square feet and consumed 150 kilowatts of power. Though it came too late for its intended wartime purpose, ENIAC proved electronic computing was possible, setting off the computer revolution.
