# The Education of Alexander the Great

## "CULTIVATION" in History

The relationship between Alexander the Great and his tutor Aristotle represents one of history's most significant examples of intentional cultivation. In 343 BCE, Philip II of Macedon engaged Aristotle to educate his 13-year-old son Alexander, understanding that the future king required more than conventional instruction. Aristotle's approach was comprehensive and carefully structured, beginning not with military strategy or politics, but with literature, philosophy, and scientific observation. He taught Alexander to explore the nature of things through direct examination, instilling both curiosity and methodical thinking. The philosopher created a special version of Homer's Iliad for Alexander, annotated with notes about leadership and heroic virtue, which the prince carried with him throughout his life. Their educational relationship lasted three critical years, during which Aristotle carefully cultivated not just Alexander's intellect but his character and worldview. This cultivation bore fruit in Alexander's later life - even during his military campaigns, he collected specimens for Aristotle's research and spread Greek learning throughout his conquered territories, establishing libraries and centers of learning. The relationship demonstrates how proper cultivation, timed perfectly and delivered appropriately, can shape not just an individual but the course of history.
