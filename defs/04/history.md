# Feynman's Revolutionary Teaching Method

## "Guidance" in History

In 1961, physicist Richard Feynman transformed undergraduate physics education at Caltech through an unconventional teaching approach. Rather than following traditional textbooks, he developed what became known as "The Feynman Lectures on Physics," starting with fundamental questions about how nature behaves.

Instead of presenting physics as a set of formulas to memorize, Feynman guided students through the process of discovery. He used simple, vivid examples â€“ explaining quantum mechanics through double-slit experiments, or angular momentum through spinning plates. Complex concepts emerged naturally from basic principles and observation.

Most revolutionary was his insistence that students learn through questioning rather than acceptance. When a student asked why magnets repel, Feynman famously spent an entire lecture exploring why "why" questions are deep and complex, teaching not just physics but how to think about physics.

The lectures proved so influential that they were published and continue to guide physics education today, demonstrating how effective teaching requires not just knowledge but the ability to lead students through their own discovery process.
