## Tholonic Analysis
### Negotiation
The hexagram represents the negotiation between stable wisdom (Ken/Mountain) and flowing uncertainty (Kan/Water). This creates learning through structured experience.

### Limitation
Structure is provided by mountain above, indicating that learning requires boundaries. Water below suggests that understanding must flow naturally.

### Contribution
This pattern contributes to evolution by showing how knowledge transfers between generations. It demonstrates how guidance shapes development.

### Significance in the Thologram
In the tholonic system, this hexagram represents where consciousness guides growth. It shows how awareness can direct development through patient instruction.

## No Moving Lines
When no lines are changing, focus on steady learning progress. Success comes through consistent study rather than rushed understanding.

## All Moving Lines
A complete transformation in how learning occurs is indicated. Old methods of instruction must give way to new forms of guidance. Ensure wisdom remains while embracing change.
