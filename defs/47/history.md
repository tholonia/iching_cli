# The Long March of Mao

## "DEPLETION" in History

In October 1934, Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party faced near annihilation. Surrounded by Nationalist forces and severely depleted in resources, they embarked on what would become known as the Long March - one of history's most remarkable examples of endurance under extreme depletion. Beginning with 86,000 troops, the Communists were forced to abandon their stronghold in Jiangxi Province, beginning a retreat that would cover over 6,000 miles through some of China's most treacherous terrain. Their resources were desperately scarce: soldiers survived on a daily ration of a handful of rice, many without shoes or adequate clothing. They crossed 18 mountain ranges and 24 rivers, often while under attack from hostile forces and dealing with severe weather conditions. The march depleted their numbers drastically - only about 8,000 of the original marchers completed the journey. Yet this period of extreme hardship ultimately strengthened the movement. The survivors developed incredible resilience and resourcefulness, and the march became a powerful symbol of determination against overwhelming odds. When they finally reached their destination in Yan'an, the remaining force had been forged into a hardened core that would eventually lead the Communist Party to victory in 1949.
