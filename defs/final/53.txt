The selection of an oak tree, realism, oil painting, and Vincent van Gogh for the hexagram “Progression” embodies the tholonic concept of higher order emergence through steady integration. The oak tree symbolizes strong, gradual growth, reflecting the emergence of complex systems from simple origins, consistent with tholonic awareness manifesting in holistic development. Realism captures the meticulous and tangible aspect of growth, akin to the precise balance and negotiation forces within a Thologram. Oil painting, as a classic and enduring medium, complements the sense of timeless progression and the integration of form and meaning, akin to the Tholon’s partons forming a cohesive whole. Vincent van Gogh’s style, renowned for its vividness and emotional depth, highlights the essence of organic transformation, resonating with the creative energy of universal love in the Tholonic Model. Collectively, these elements portray an award-winning, symbolically rich representation of gradual, natural progression.
