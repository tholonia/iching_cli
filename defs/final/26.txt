The hexagram "Cultivation," symbolizing challenges, testing, and controlling powerful forces, is aptly represented by a mountain in Katsushika Hokusai's award-winning, highly symbolic oil painting. The mountain embodies stability and strength, reflecting the need for perseverance and mastery over formidable elements. Hokusai's realism enhances this symbolism by capturing the mountain's grandeur and enduring presence, which aligns with the Tholonic concept of awareness negotiating balance and limitation to create new structures. The use of oil paints adds depth and texture, highlighting the mountain's imposing nature, while also suggesting the Tholonic idea of integration and emergence, where each brushstroke contributes to a larger whole. Hokusai's ability to convey profound meaning through art parallels the I Ching's role in guiding personal growth and understanding through intricate symbols.
