The hexagram Penetration is symbolically expressed through the monochrome, minimalist landscape imagery, chosen to highlight the subtle power and cyclic nature of transformation envisioned in the I Ching. The choice of medium, pencil, captures the organic yet structured flow of awareness manifesting through natural formsâ€”a reflection of tholonic concepts where awareness and intention continuously shape reality. The serene pencil strokes blend earth and sky, embodying universal love's drive for harmonious creation. The acacias with deep roots symbolize renewal and resilience, illustrating the Thologram's recursive structure where each Tholon (earth, sky, grasses) contributes to a larger whole through negotiation, limitation, and contribution. This artistic approach aligns with the tholonic emphasis on interconnectedness and transformation as gentle persistence generates profound change, mirroring the hexagram's essence.
