In representing the hexagram "Incremental Progress," the choice of a bird in a realistic watercolor style by Fan Kuan beautifully embodies the theme of completion and renewal, as well as transcending limits. Birds symbolize freedom and the constant journey between earth and sky, mirroring the concept of returning to the source through awareness and intention as outlined in the Tholonic Model. The watercolor medium, known for its fluidity and the way colors blend seamlessly, reflects the nature of awareness forming interconnected patterns, akin to a Thologram. Fan Kuan, celebrated for his mastery in landscape art, channels the complexity and recursive beauty of nature, aligning with the idea of tholons integrating into larger wholes. This metaphorically illustrates the balance of negotiation, limitation, and contribution, encapsulating the holistic evolution of existence in the broader context of consciousness as contextual awareness.
