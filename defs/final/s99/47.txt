The choice of batteries as the object in this hexagram reflects the theme of "Depletion," symbolizing their life cycle of discharge and eventual renewal. The realism style, paired with SebastiaÌƒo Salgado's award-winning symbolic approach, captures the tangible, grounded quality of this cyclical process, tying it to real-world, universal experiences. By using ink, a medium with deep contrasts, the artwork emphasizes the duality of depletion and renewal, akin to the dynamic forces within the Thologram: negotiation, limitation, and contribution. The scene highlights the interconnectedness of human activity and energetic processes, resonating with Tholonic principles where awareness transforms states towards completion, echoing the hexagram's subtheme of resolution and the essential cycle of exhaustion leading to rejuvenation.
