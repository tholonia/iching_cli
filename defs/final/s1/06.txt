The choice of storm clouds as the object embodies the theme of "CONFLICT" and primal creation through their inherent creative tension, reflecting the dynamic interplay and balance of forces in the Tholonic Model. Expressionism, known for conveying emotional experience rather than physical reality, parallels the subjective nature of awareness shaping reality, making it apt for illustrating the intense emotional energies at play. Atmospheric photography as the medium captures the raw, elemental power and immediacy of the storm, akin to the tholonic energy driving creation and transformation. Despite not being an actual practitioner, attributing the piece to Vincent van Gogh symbolizes the intense awareness and emotive style that align with the transformative, emergent properties central to the Tholonic Model. Together, these elements evoke the award-winning, highly symbolic nature of the hexagram, illustrating the primal definition and emergence of basic forms amid conflict.
