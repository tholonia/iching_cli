In this artistic representation, the carved stone revealing fresh surfaces symbolizes inner growth and transformation, akin to the Tholonic Model's idea of awareness manifesting through layers of complexity. The abstract expressionism style allows for a symbolic exploration of this internal development, capturing the essence of breaking through old patterns to reveal new potential. Using wood carving as the medium aligns with the theme of restoration and organic evolution, reflecting the natural emergence of consciousness as layers are unveiled. Anselm Kiefer, known for his deeply symbolic and textured works, embodies the process of inner correction and holistic expression through materiality, mirroring the recursive self-reflection found in the Thologram. Collectively, these elements depict an award-winning, highly symbolic journey of awareness negotiating, defining, and integrating its facets into a cohesive whole.
