The choice of a guidebook or compass in the style of realism by Albrecht Dürer, using ink, effectively symbolizes the hexagram's theme, "Primal Definition; Creation of Basic Forms." The guidebook or compass represents direction and learning, encapsulating the raw potential seeking form, akin to the Tholonic Model’s idea of awareness seeking manifestation. Realism ensures clarity and precision, mirroring the primal definitions taking shape. Dürer's mastery in symbolic realism enriches the artwork's depth, capturing the intricate balance of awareness and intention in creation. Ink, as a medium, denotes permanence and clarity, reinforcing the foundational nature of the primal forms. This combination embodies the hexagram's essence by illustrating the vibrant interplay of guidance, possibility, and the emergence of structure.
