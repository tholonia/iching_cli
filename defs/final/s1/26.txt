The choice of a mountain in Hokusai's oil painting, with its realistic style, beautifully symbolizes the hexagram's theme of "Cultivation"—the process of facing challenges and harnessing powerful forces. Mountains represent immovable strength and endurance, reflecting the need to control and master challenges, making them ideal metaphors for personal growth and resilience. Hokusai, renowned for his ability to capture the intricate details of nature, uses the detailed realism of oil painting to embody the intricate interplay of awareness and intention within the Tholonic Model. The medium’s depth and texture mirror the layers of complexity within the journey of cultivation, where each brushstroke contributes to the larger holarchy, illustrating the emergent strength found within equilibrium and balance. This synthesis reflects the Tholonic principles of negotiation, limitation, and contribution, symbolizing the integration of powerful energies into a cohesive form of consciousness.
