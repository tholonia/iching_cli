The choice of a tiger in surrealist oil painting by Salvador Dalí symbolizes the theme of "POTENTIAL" and "EARLY DEVELOPMENT," intertwined with the essence of building structure mindfully. The tiger represents raw power and latent potential, encapsulating the primal energy emerging from the Tholonic "Primal Point," aligning with the concept of awareness shaping reality. Dalí's surrealism, with its dream-like fluidity, captures the complex, self-similar Thologram structure where conscious awareness develops and defines its boundaries, reflecting the tholonic dynamic of negotiation and limitation. Using oil as the medium adds richness and depth, symbolizing the layered complexity of awareness manifesting through intention. The award-winning nature of the piece highlights its integration and contribution to a cohesive larger system, mirroring the emergence of new properties through mindful progress within the Tholonic Model.
