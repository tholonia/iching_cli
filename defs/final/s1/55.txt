The choice of thunder and lightning as the object in this representation of the hexagram "MOMENTUM" symbolizes the raw, transformative power of nature, echoing the theme of final integration and higher-order emergence. This dynamic energy reflects the tholonic concept of universal love as a creative force, guiding the manifestation of awareness into reality. The style of Futurism complements this by emphasizing movement and progress, resonating with the innovative spirit of reaching peak flowering. The medium of digital painting captures the fusion of traditional artistic techniques with modern technology, representing the negotiation and integration of new paradigms. Although Picasso is historically unrelated to digital art, his revolutionary approach to form and abstraction mirrors the tholonic process of consciousness manifesting complex systems. Thus, these elements together embody the culmination and synthesis inherent in this hexagram.
