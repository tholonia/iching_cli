The choice of a cow, painted by Sesshū Tōyō in the minimalist style with watercolor, symbolizes the hexagram of Receptivity through its embodiment of primal, nurturing forces. The cow represents sustenance and the pure, receptive energy essential to primal definition, aligning with universal love as a creative force in the Tholonic Model. Watercolor, with its fluidity and capacity for layering, mirrors the harmonious balance and integration within the Thologram. The minimalism reflects the purity and simplicity of receptive force, highlighting the essence without distraction. Sesshū Tōyō, known for integrating Zen philosophy with art, captures this process of emergence and awareness, emphasizing how fundamental structures arise from pure intention and awareness. This synthesis of form, medium, and style beautifully illustrates the universal principles of receptivity and creation.
