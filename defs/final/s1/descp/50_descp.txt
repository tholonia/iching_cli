This hexagram imparts elements of symbolic integration to the crescendoed tholon of ultimate assimilation, thus giving birth to an ordering of superior emergence. It renders a perspective whereby the structured space becomes an arena for the play of metamorphosis. Its essential persona is derided from an alchemical and sacred transformational energy, birthing the very conditions necessary for catalyzing change, with its fundamental essence lying in the act of manifestation. The key to its triumph is found in the respectful acknowledgment of the process married with meticulous preparation. The energy it resonates with is that of a preponderantly descending yang. The significant challenge to surmount is in achieving uninterrupted preservation of the sacred transformational space.
