This hexagram imbues the tholon of primal definition with a raw potential that yearns for manifestation, contributing to the genesis of elemental forms.This vista offers unswerving guidance as it navigates through the cloudy waters of uncertainty. By nature, it is didactic, patiently elucidating the process of materializing through its teachings. It garners success not through swiftness and force, but through the gentle constancy of persistence and the lucid illustration of examples. Its energy perfumes the atmosphere as the descending yang power emerges. The obstacle it must surmount is to uphold the suited rhythm of instruction without faltering.
