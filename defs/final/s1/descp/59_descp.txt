This hexagram imparts unto the tholon of completion and renewal a distinctive quality of returning to its origin. Its perspective is colored by a transformative shift from rigid patterns, yielding instead to an array of fluid possibilities. Pervasive, transformative, and liberating in nature, this hexagram dismantles barriers, giving way to a smooth stream of manifestation. Success is bountifully harvested through the gentle yet persistent dissolution of obstacles. Its energy exhibits a balanced descent. The challenge here it poses, however, is the upkeep of coherence amid the process of dissolution.
