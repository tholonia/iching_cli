This hexagram imparts a sense of cohesive stability to the apex of integration, nurturing the rise of superior order. It dons a lens of seeking potency and lucidity through the hush of conscious tranquillity. The nature of this hexagram is rooted in stabilisation, it is fundamentally grounded and contemplative. Its passive demeanor of observation and meditation breeds manifestation. With the virtues of patient observation and internal peace, it triumphs. This hexagram exudes an energy that is like a nascent yang descending from above. The solitary hill to conquer here is the preservation of stillness without succumbing to the trappings of rigidity.
