The object of lightning symbolizes a sudden, decisive resolution, mirroring the theme of breakthrough and completion intrinsic to this hexagram. Lightning represents the tholonic forces of negotiation and contribution, sparking balance and integration through a powerful, illuminating strike. The style of Futurism, with its emphasis on dynamic movement and modernity, encapsulates the forward momentum toward resolution, aligning with awareness manifesting in a new form. Digital illustration as the medium reflects the conceptual energy of the Tholonic Model, where digital technology embodies the limitless potential of awareness interacting with itself. Although Jackson Pollock is known for abstract expressionism, his symbolic energy resonates with tholonic principles of complex patterns and emergent creativity. This combination results in a dynamic, award-winning, and highly symbolic representation of decisive resolution.
