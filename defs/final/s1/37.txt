In this work, a wolf pack is chosen to symbolize "FAMILY DYNAMICS," representing the theme of transformation through active change in group dynamics. Wolves embody balance and negotiation within a social hierarchy, reflecting the holarchic nature of the Thologram where each member is both a whole and a part. Realism as the style underscores authenticity, capturing intricate social interactions akin to the interdependent connections within the Thologram. The digital medium allows for precise representation, akin to how conceptual energy organizes abstract themes into clarity. Although the artist cannot be truly identified as Jack London, invoking his name suggests narratives of survival and collective strength, mirroring tholonic energy guiding intention and awareness in the creation of cohesive systems. The award-winning, symbolic quality highlights universal love as a guiding creative force, emphasizing harmony and integration within the family unit.
