The choice of wind as the object for the hexagram emphasizes the theme of subtle penetration and the cyclical nature of completion and renewal. Wind, a symbol of invisible yet profound influence, aligns with the Tholonic Model’s emphasis on awareness and intention as formless forces shaping reality. Minimalism, depicted in pencil by Henri Matisse, supports the concept of returning to the source—the clarity and simplicity of lines reflect the essence of self-similarity and holarchy, where complexity emerges from elemental simplicity. Matisse's ability to convey profound meaning through minimal strokes represents the negotiation force within the Thologram, harmonizing elements to birth new interpretations. The award-winning, highly symbolic nature of this work resonates with tholonic energy, evoking the integration and emergence of new properties from foundational awareness.
