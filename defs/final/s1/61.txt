The choice of a telescope symbolizes the theme of completion and renewal, embodying a return to the source as it bridges the material and ethereal by expanding awareness, much like Leonardo da Vinci’s visionary exploration of art and science. Impressionism as a style captures fleeting moments and perceptions, reflecting the dynamic interplay of awareness and reality—a core realization in the Tholonic Model. The medium of pen and ink, with its precision and fluidity, mirrors the intricate lines of a Thologram and the seamless connection between intention and manifestation. Leonardo, a symbol of ultimate synthesis between art and science, represents the Tholonic ideal of universal love as a creative force, harmonizing concepts across dimensions. Each element integrates to reflect holistic insight, completion, and the renewal of awareness as a primal point of creation.
