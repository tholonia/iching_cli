The choice of a pack of wolves, rendered in watercolor in an impressionistic style by J. M. W. Turner, to symbolize the hexagram of "Anticipation" represents the primal definition and creation of basic forms through patient development. Wolves embody the forces of negotiation and contribution within the packâ€”a holarchic system where the collective awareness and intention create a cohesive unit. The impressionistic style mirrors the gentle, unfolding nature of anticipation, capturing the ephemeral essence of early forms. Watercolor, as a medium, allows for a fluid interplay between form and background, reflecting the dynamic and evolving interaction of tholonic energy within the creative process. Turner's mastery and symbolic depth bring a timeless quality, aligning with the universal love and balance inherent in anticipation and primal definition.
