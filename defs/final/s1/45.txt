The object, style, medium, and artist were selected to embody the essence of the hexagram "CONVERGENCE" due to their inherent symbolic connections to the theme of resolution and unity. The river signifies the flow of time and consciousness, representing the journey towards the completion of understanding and integration, akin to tholonic energy guiding awareness into cohesive forms. Impressionism, with its emphasis on capturing ephemeral moments and the interplay of light, aligns with the dynamic, evolving nature of awareness as it seeks resolution. The mosaic medium, composed of fragmented pieces coming together to form a unified whole, mirrors the Tholonic Model's holarchic structure, illustrating how individual elements coalesce into a larger system. Although Picasso was not involved, his reputation for blending diverse styles and forms parallels the merging pathways of consciousness that the hexagram suggests. This combination of elements creates a powerful symbolic image of convergence, unity, and completion.
