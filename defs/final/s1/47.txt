The selection of batteries as the object symbolizes the theme of depletion and renewal, embodying the cyclical energy dynamics described in the Tholonic Model, where awareness and intention drive transformation. The realist style captures tangible moments of struggle and renewal, highlighting the resolution phases before rejuvenation. Ink as a medium emphasizes contrast, mirroring the tension and balance in tholonic forces like negotiation and limitation, which govern the transition from depletion to renewal. Sebasti√£o Salgado, known for his evocative depictions of human resilience, aligns with the symbolism of universal love as a creative force, portraying the interconnectedness of people and their environments. This award-winning, highly symbolic work thus intricately weaves the concepts of awareness, transformation, and the emergence of new potentials through structured intent and balance.
