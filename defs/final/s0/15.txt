The image of a mountain resting on earth, represented through marble sculptures, embodies Hexagram 15, "Equilibrium," symbolizing balance and proper restraint. The solid yet graceful forms convey a sense of grounded stability and harmony, resonating with the tholonic concept of limitation, where boundaries provide structure and balance. The minimalist and balanced style reflects the simplicity and clarity of equilibrium, emphasizing the interplay between strength and poise. The marble medium enhances the timeless and enduring quality of balance, capturing its permanence and purity. Inspired by the precision and proportional ideals of Polykleitos, this portrayal achieves a profound sense of harmony, making it a perfect representation of equilibrium as a cornerstone of growth and stability.
