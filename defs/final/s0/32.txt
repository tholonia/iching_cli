The choice of a tree as the object symbolizes endurance and sustainable momentum, embodying the theme of challenges and steadfastness through its deep roots and towering strength, akin to awareness manifesting in nature. Realism allows for an authentic, detailed portrayal of this resilience, capturing the tree's essence as both a self-contained whole and a part of a larger ecosystemâ€”a tholon in the world's holarchy. Watercolor as a medium offers fluidity and subtle gradation, akin to the tholonic energy that underlies dynamic, emerging systems. Katsushika Hokusai, renowned for his mastery in capturing nature through art, imparts an award-winning, highly symbolic quality to the piece, aligning universal love and intention with the creative expressions of awareness. Through these elements, the artwork becomes a vivid reflection of the I Ching hexagram it represents, emphasizing balance, definition, and integration within the recursive structures of existence.
