The image of a tiger observing its surroundings embodies Hexagram 10, "Potential," by symbolizing the latent energy and mindful awareness required for deliberate progress. The tiger, poised and attentive, reflects the balance of strength and restraint, aligning with the tholonic concept of negotiation, where power is directed with purpose. The poetic and dynamic style captures the tension between stillness and action, illustrating the careful cultivation of readiness. The medium of oil on canvas provides depth and texture, emphasizing the layered complexity of potential. Salvador Dalí’s surreal vision amplifies the interplay between observation and imagination, making this depiction a profound exploration of potential as an active yet measured force in the process of development.
