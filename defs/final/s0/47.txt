The choice of batteries as the object symbolizes the cycle of energy depletion and renewal, reflecting the hexagram's theme of resolution and completion. The realism style captures the raw, unembellished nature of depletion before renewal, highlighting the transient state between exhaustion and potential energy. Ink, with its ability to convey depth and contrast, symbolizes the stark, enduring nature of this cycle, while emphasizing the intricate interconnectedness within the Thologram. Sebasti√£o Salgado, known for his poignant, impactful imagery, effectively communicates the universality of struggle and rebirth, resonating with the tholonic idea that from depletion arises a new dimension of awareness. The award-winning, highly symbolic quality of the artwork underscores the depth of this transformation, embodying the negotiation between limitation and contribution for emerging balance.
