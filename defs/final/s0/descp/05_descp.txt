This hexagram infuses the tholon of primal definition with the virtues of patient evolution, breathing life into rudimentary formations. It emanates a perspective of latent energy, poised on the brink of action, biding its time to strike. Its essence is one of premeditation, its modus operandi steeped in strategically delayed manifestation. Through these measured intervals of readiness, it threads the needle of success. Its life force dances to the ascendant rhythm of dominant yang energy. The challenge it confronts is to uphold a vivid alertness amidst the stillness of delay.
