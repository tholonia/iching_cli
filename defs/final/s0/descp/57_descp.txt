This hexagram bestows the delicate qualities of penetration to the symphony of fulfillment and rejuvenation, a return to origins. It presents an intriguing vista of the compounded strength derived from sustained, barely perceptible influence. It thrives throughout a consistent nature: tenacious, adaptable, enveloping, deftly asserting its soft, constant influence. Its progress operates on the principle of manifestation. Achievement is realized through unyielding, subliminal pressure; success delicately wrung from consistency rather than intensity. Its energy echoes the descending dominance of Yang. The challenge it presents, however, lies in sustaining persistence without resorting to force; an artful perseverance to persist without coercion.
