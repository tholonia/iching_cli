Imbuing the tholon of transformation with traits of strategic retreat, this hexagram fosters an active change. It gives one the view that deliberately choosing to curtail engagement can kindle rejuvenation and future flourishing. The inherent nature of this hexagram is rooted in discreet withdrawal, whilst its deliberate disentanglement acts as a process of manifestation. It garners triumph not through brute force but calculated discernment and precise timing. The energy it radiates is a dominant descent of yang. The test it imposes is the challenge of preserving internal fortitude whilst perceptibly acquiescing.
