The choice of a garden as the object in "Mindful Expansion" represents the natural progression toward completion and beneficial growth, embodying the awareness and intention fundamental to the Tholonic Model. Impressionism captures the dynamic, evolving nature of this growth, using soft, fluid brushstrokes to mirror the interconnectedness and emergent patterns within a Thologram. Using collage as a medium emphasizes the integration and negotiation—key Tholonic forces—as various elements come together to form a cohesive whole. Georgia O'Keeffe, known for her symbolic and evocative works, aptly represents the hexagram’s essence through her focus on nature's forms, enhancing the symbolic resonance of the piece. The award-winning quality of the artwork reflects its successful embodiment of these tholonic principles, harmoniously integrating awareness, intention, and universal love into a unified vision of expansion.
