The choice of a jazz ensemble, Impressionism, music as a medium, and Pablo Picasso as the artist symbolizes the hexagram's theme of completion and renewal through dynamic harmony and creative spontaneity. Jazz, with its fluidity and improvisation, mirrors the Tholonic Model's principles of awareness and interaction, embracing integration and contribution as musicians respond to each other, creating a transcendent whole. Impressionism captures fleeting moments of joy and fulfillment, resonating with the idea of fulfilled joy and renewal. The musical medium enhances the holistic and non-tangible aspects of resonance, echoing tholonic energy's influence in shaping experiences and connections. Picasso, renowned for breaking conventional boundaries and symbolic expression, embodies universal love and creativity, driving the endless renewal and expansive patterns of the Thologram, reflecting a return to the source of awareness and intention.
