The choice of a well as the object in Georgia O'Keeffe's award-winning watercolor represents the hexagram theme of "Restoration" through its symbolic connotations of depth and source, echoing the foundational search implicit in resolution. The impressionist style captures the fluidity and transitional aspects of water, a medium that naturally embodies movement toward completion or fulfillment, aligning with the subtheme. Watercolor enhances this symbolism with its translucency and flow, suggesting the seamless negotiation between elements, a core aspect of tholonic concepts. O'Keeffe, an artist known for abstracting and distilling natural forms, serves as the perfect conduit for this symbolic exploration, embodying the tholonic principle of awareness manifesting through both physical form and deeper intention.
