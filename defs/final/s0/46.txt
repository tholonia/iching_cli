The object of a growing tree represents the hexagram "EMERGENCE" through its symbolic portrayal of life’s ascending movement towards completion, reflecting natural cycles of growth and resolution. The realist style captures the intricate details of this progression, mirroring the Tholonic concept of awareness manifesting through complex systems. Carving this from wood emphasizes transformation and the emergence of hidden potential from raw material, akin to the evolutionary process of awareness interacting and evolving. Choosing Vincent van Gogh as the artist adds depth, as his works often explore themes of life’s cyclical nature, embodying universal love and creativity. This award-winning, highly symbolic piece serves as a tholon—both a holistic entity and part of a larger holarchic system, engaging with the dynamics of negotiation, limitation, and contribution to reflect the interconnectedness and unfolding reality.
