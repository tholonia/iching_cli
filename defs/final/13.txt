The image of a flame uniting light and heat embodies Hexagram 13, "Coalition," symbolizing the formation of basic connections that bring individuals and elements together in shared purpose. The interplay of glowing warmth and structural lines reflects the tholonic concept of integration, where distinct components merge harmoniously to create greater unity. The collaborative and vibrant style underscores the dynamic interplay of energies, while the medium of acrylic on canvas captures the depth and intensity of this unifying process. Edgar Degas, renowned for his ability to convey subtle relationships and movement, brings life and cohesion to this portrayal, making it a profound representation of coalition as the foundation of collective growth and harmony.
