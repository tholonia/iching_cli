The choice of thunder and lightning as objects in this digital painting represents the dynamic energy and sudden illumination of the "MOMENTUM" hexagram, symbolizing the peak flowering of awareness leading to higher order emergence. The futurism style captures the forward thrust and rapid transformation inherent in this theme, reflecting the integration of past, present, and future potentials manifesting into reality. Digital painting as a medium allows for the seamless blend of complexity and precision, mirroring the self-similar, recursive nature of the Thologram and its multidimensional creation process. Although not actually created by Picasso, invoking his name suggests the innovative spirit and symbolic depth often associated with his work, aligning with the tholonic concept of universal love as the creative force driving this emergent integration.
