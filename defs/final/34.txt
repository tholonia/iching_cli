The object of a ram in Rivera’s ink-fueled futurism symbolizes the raw primal force of transformation and active change, capturing the essence of the hexagram "BREAKTHROUGH FORCE." The ram, embodying power and determination, aligns with tholonic concepts by representing a Tholon: a whole entity that is simultaneously part of a dynamic, evolving system. The style of futurism, with its emphasis on movement and technological advancement, reflects this theme of transformation, mirroring the tholonic principle of awareness evolving through complex interactions. Employing ink as the medium taps into the notion of conceptual energy within the Tholonic Model—fluid, impactful, and expansive. Rivera, known for integrating powerful symbolism into his work, effectively conveys the transformative forces, making the piece award-winning and deeply resonant with themes of active change and harnessing force.
