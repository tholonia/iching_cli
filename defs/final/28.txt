The "CRITICAL MASS" hexagram, embodying themes of challenge and the handling of excess, finds a fitting representation in the surrealistic lithograph featuring a dam by Georgia O'Keeffe. The dam symbolizes the negotiation and limitation forces within the Tholonic Model, illustrating how awareness channels and handles vast energies and emotions akin to water. Surrealism enhances this depiction, distorting reality to capture the complex, often overwhelming experiences of testing and strengthening. Lithography's intricacy and ability to convey subtle nuances mirror the Tholonic interaction among elements, as each line and shadow speaks to the emergent properties of awareness under pressure. Georgia O'Keeffe, renowned for symbolic expression, serves as an ideal artist to convey these dynamics, her work embodying the harmonious integration—contribution—of natural forms and human resilience. Her award-winning approach amplifies the symbolic meaning, underlining the creative power behind conceptual balance and transformation.
