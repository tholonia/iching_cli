The image of thunder over a lake, depicted through fluid lines and vibrant contrasts, captures Hexagram 17, "Resonance," symbolizing adaptability and alignment in the dynamic interplay of forces. The intertwining branches and clouds illustrate the tholonic concept of negotiation, where harmony is achieved through the delicate balance of opposing energies. The harmonious and fluid style reflects the natural rhythm of resonance, while the medium of watercolor on silk conveys an ethereal softness and interconnected flow. Katsushika Hokusai, with his mastery of capturing the sublime in nature, brings this imagery to life, portraying the transformative and unifying power of resonance in growth and alignment.
