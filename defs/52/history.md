# The Cuban Missile Crisis Resolution

## "STILLNESS" in History

On October 27, 1962, at the height of the Cuban Missile Crisis, President John F. Kennedy made a remarkable decision that exemplified the power of stillness. Despite intense pressure from his military advisors to launch an immediate attack on Cuba, and despite the shooting down of an American U-2 spy plane that morning, Kennedy chose inaction. For a full day, he remained in deliberate stillness, refusing to escalate the situation. While his generals pushed for immediate retaliation, Kennedy understood that any hasty action could trigger nuclear war. Instead of responding to the immediate provocation, he focused on a letter received from Khrushchev the previous day, ignoring a more belligerent message received that morning. This calculated stillness - this refusal to react - created space for diplomacy to work. His strategic inaction, maintaining calm while the world teetered on the brink of nuclear war, allowed tensions to ease and gave the Soviet leadership room to find a face-saving way to withdraw. Kennedy's deliberate pause in the face of unprecedented crisis became one of history's most powerful examples of how stillness and non-action can be the most effective response to extreme pressure.
