# The Cuban Missile Preparation

## "Anticipation" in History

In October 1962, when US intelligence first detected Soviet missile installations in Cuba, President Kennedy faced immense pressure for immediate military action. Instead, he chose a path of strategic waiting - gathering intelligence, preparing multiple response options, and carefully timing the US reaction.

For thirteen days, while hawks in his cabinet pushed for air strikes, Kennedy maintained a posture of active preparation. He secretly recorded strategy sessions, consulted diverse viewpoints, and developed a naval quarantine plan. Each day of waiting allowed for better intelligence, more prepared responses, and crucially, time for diplomatic back-channels to operate.

This period of high-stakes anticipation proved crucial. The careful gathering of photographic evidence made the case internationally. The time spent gaming out scenarios helped avoid catastrophic miscalculations. When Kennedy finally announced the quarantine, every piece was in place for a measured response that gave the Soviets room to withdraw without humiliation.

The crisis demonstrated how strategic waiting, filled with intensive preparation, could be more powerful than immediate action. Kennedy's patient but ready posture created the conditions for a resolution that avoided nuclear war.
