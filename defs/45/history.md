# The First Continental Congress

## "CONVERGENCE" in History

In September 1774, fifty-six delegates from twelve colonies gathered at Carpenters' Hall in Philadelphia, marking an unprecedented moment of colonial unity in the face of British oppression. Each colony had its own interests, traditions, and concerns, yet the growing pressure from British taxation and restrictions created a powerful impetus for cooperation. The delegates represented a remarkable cross-section of colonial society - lawyers, merchants, farmers, and plantation owners. Despite their differences and initial skepticism, they managed to find common ground. Through careful deliberation and compromise, they crafted the Continental Association, a unified response to British policies that included a coordinated boycott of British goods. The Congress also established key channels for inter-colonial communication and cooperation, creating the first formal networks between previously separate colonies. This gathering proved to be a crucial step toward American independence, demonstrating how diverse interests could unite under shared principles and goals. The Congress concluded with an agreement to reconvene if necessary - a provision that would prove vital when the Second Continental Congress met to declare independence less than two years later. This historical moment perfectly exemplifies the hexagram's themes of gathering, unity, and the power of collective purpose.
