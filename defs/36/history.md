# The Underground Railroad

## "Obscured Light" in History

Between 1810 and 1850, the Underground Railroad represented one of history's most powerful examples of light persisting through darkness. Harriet Tubman, known as "Moses" to those she helped free, conducted 19 secret missions along this clandestine network of safe houses and hidden routes. Operating under the constant threat of capture, she and other conductors developed intricate systems of codes and signals. Quilts hung on clotheslines contained map symbols, lanterns in windows indicated safe houses, and spirituals contained hidden messages about escape routes. In total, the Underground Railroad helped an estimated 100,000 enslaved people reach freedom, all while maintaining strict secrecy. The entire operation functioned like a flame burning beneath the earth - invisible to those above but providing crucial light to those who needed to find their way to freedom.
