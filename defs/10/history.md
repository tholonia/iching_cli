# Lincoln's First Inaugural Response

## "Potential" in History

In March 1861, when seven Southern states had already seceded and civil war seemed inevitable, Abraham Lincoln delivered his first inaugural address from a position of immense but precarious power. As the newly-installed President, he commanded the nation's military might, yet understood that an aggressive display of force would likely trigger immediate conflict.

Instead of threatening the South or making a show of federal power, Lincoln chose a path of measured restraint. His address carefully balanced firmness with conciliation, famously concluding "We are not enemies, but friends... Though passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds of affection."

Even as he assured the South that he had no intention to interfere with slavery where it existed, he made clear his constitutional duty to preserve the Union. When he did mention federal power, it was with careful precision: "Beyond what may be necessary for these objects, there will be no invasion, no using of force against or among the people anywhere."

This masterful display of controlled strength - showing power while choosing when and how to use it - exemplifies the essence of treading carefully while possessing great force. Though war eventually came, Lincoln's measured approach helped secure crucial border states and demonstrated to the world that the Union sought peace while possessing the strength for war.
