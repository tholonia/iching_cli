# The Rise of Ancient Rome

## "EMERGENCE" in History

Rome's ascent from a small settlement on the Tiber River to the greatest empire of the ancient world exemplifies the hexagram's theme of gradual, persistent emergence. Founded in 753 BCE, Rome began as a modest collection of villages on seven hills. Unlike the rapid conquests of Alexander the Great, Rome's expansion occurred through a steady, methodical process spanning centuries. The early Romans focused first on building strong foundations - creating legal and social institutions like the Senate, developing military discipline through small-scale conflicts with neighboring cities, and establishing practical innovations in architecture and engineering. Their progress was marked by setbacks and challenges, including the sack of Rome by the Gauls in 390 BCE, yet each challenge led to adaptive improvements rather than defeat. The Romans' patient approach to growth was exemplified in their famous road system, built gradually but constructed so well that many routes still exist today. This methodical expansion continued for over 500 years until, by the time of Augustus in 27 BCE, Rome had emerged as the undisputed power in the Mediterranean world. Their success came not through sudden conquest but through persistent advancement, practical innovation, and the ability to learn and adapt from both victories and setbacks.
