# Image Resolution

To calculate the minimum resolution in pixels per inch (PPI) for a high-quality print image in the available space, follow these steps:

1. **Page Size and Margins:**
   - Page dimensions: 6.69 x 9.61 inches
   - Margins: 1 inch on each side
   - Printable area:
     - Width: 6.69−2×1=4.696.69 - 2 \times 1 = 4.69 inches
     - Height: 9.61−2×1=7.619.61 - 2 \times 1 = 7.61 inches
2. **High-Quality Print PPI:**
   - A high-quality print typically requires at least **300 PPI**.
3. **Calculate the Required Resolution:**
   - Width in pixels: 4.69×300=14074.69 \times 300 = 1407 pixels
   - Height in pixels: 7.61×300=22837.61 \times 300 = 2283 pixels

Thus, the minimum resolution of the image should be **1407 x 2283 pixels** at **300 PPI** to ensure high quality when printed in that space.
