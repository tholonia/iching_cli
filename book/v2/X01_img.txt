The image employs an impressionistic style, characterized by its fluid strokes, luminous interplay of light and color, and an ethereal sense of motion. This style was chosen to represent Hexagram 01, "Creation," because it captures the dynamic, unbounded energy of pure yang and the primordial act of manifestation. The impressionistic technique mirrors the spontaneous, transformative nature of creative force, where forms emerge organically from chaos. The vibrant, celestial palette conveys the vast, cosmic scale of creation, while the soaring phoenixes embody the dynamic ascent and evolution of awareness. The style resonates deeply with the hexagram's essence of transcendental genesis.
