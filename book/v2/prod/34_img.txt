"'Breakthrough Force' takes visual form through a composition that emphasizes dynamism, intensity and the potential for transformation. The image's storm clouds and lightning personify the releasing of latent energy, showcasing the conversion from potential to kinetic. As a visual metaphor for powerful, transformative action, the central figure balancing amidst the storm signifies the human ability to channel and orchestrate this potent force. The picture's copious depiction of lightning—which is associated with both the thunder and heaven aspects of the hexagram —emphasizes the contextual foundation of this force, while the swirling sky suggests the emergent structures born from this potent dynamic expression."
