"Stagnation" is perfectly encapsulated through the imagery of a dammed river, drawn in an evocative ink-on-vellum illustration. This image symbolizes the blockage and temporary cessation of flow which embodies the key concept of Hexagram 12. The choice of the still, reflective water underscores the theme of limitation, while the intricate details of the dam suggest the inherent complexities of this seemingly static state. The famous Neo-Impressionist Edgar Degas' style, with its hallmark subtlety and introspective quality, adds profound depth and nuance to this representation of the critical phase of stillness before renewal.
