"Potential" represents the dynamic state of latent power that is yet to be realized. It can be likened to a tiger in the wild, observing its surroundings and waiting for the perfect moment to pounce. This is a concept that is seen in all aspects of the universe, from the dormant energy within an atom waiting to be released, to a seed beneath the soil, brimming with the potential to become a towering tree. In humans too, we see the concept of "Potential" in our unrealized talents and capabilities, waiting for the right environment and opportunity to manifest. It is a reminder of the power held within all things, requiring only the right conditions to be unleashed.

In the context of the tholonic model, "Potential" symbolizes the interplay of awareness and intention. It is the *contribution* of the central concept that brings together the two components, often seen as the *negotiation* between the internal and external realities. The power of "Potential" is held in check by our awareness, requiring the *limitation* of disciplined restraint to ensure it is expressed at the optimal moment. This mindful conduct, when balanced with the inherent strength of the potential, leads to successful manifestation. The challenge, therefore, lies in maintaining control while possessing this strength, a testament to the intricate dance between being and becoming.
