"Coalition" represents the power of combined forces working towards a common purpose. This is seen in the universe as the synergistic effects of different energies combining in harmony, much like light and heat uniting to create a flame. Within society, "Coalition" can be observed in the formation of alliances and partnerships, where diverse groups or individuals unite for a shared cause. On a personal level, it embodies the harmony of our various skills, attributes, and experiences working together to achieve our goals. The challenge lies in maintaining individual integrity while functioning within collective action.

In the Tholonic perspective, "Coalition" is viewed as the *negotiation* between different elements, seeking alignment and harmony in their shared purpose. The central concept, or the *contribution*, is the shared understanding that guides the creative power of the coalition. It's about *limitation* too, as each participant must balance their individuality with the collective needs of the group. When these elements are successfully balanced, it results in a unifying action that builds connections and harmonizes diverse elements. The image of fire rising to heaven can be seen as the manifestation of this shared intention, amplifying the collective power of the group.
