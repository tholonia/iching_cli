"Dissolution" symbolizes the process of breaking down barriers and dissolving separation. In the natural world, we see this in the form of ice melting into water or rigid structures becoming flexible. This transformation from solid to fluid states unlocks the potential for new connections and pathways. In our personal lives, this could represent the process of letting go of rigid beliefs or structures to allow for greater flexibility and growth. The challenge lies in maintaining coherence and structure during this period of dissolution.

In the Tholonic model, "Dissolution" is seen as a shift from rigid patterns to fluid possibilities. It is about gently but persistently dissolving obstacles for the creation of flow. This process is transformative and liberating, representing the dispersive and fluid nature of awareness and intention. It emphasizes the importance of *negotiation*, which involves finding balance and harmony amidst change, and *limitation*, which calls for maintaining coherence during the process of dissolution. The action here is to create an environment that encourages the breakdown of barriers and encourages new connections.
