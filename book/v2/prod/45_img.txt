"Convergence" is richly embodied through elements and styles that mirror its core principles. The image portrays a river joining varied paths, paralleling the tholonic concept of interconnected awareness. The negotiation force is represented by the harmonious merging of the different elements of the landscape, analogous to how tholonic energy assimilates diverse dimensions of awareness. Impressionist techniques underscore the dynamic, evolving nature inherent in the tholonic model. The integration of Picasso's abstraction into mosaic art mirrors Holarchy's structure, reflecting the principle of unity amidst diversity. The fusion of these elements manifests the journey towards completion central to the theme of "Convergence."
