"Mastering Flow" is aptly illustrated through the image of a riverâ€” a symbol of raw power, relentless force, and dynamic negotiation, embodying the Tholonic principles of awareness continually manifesting in changing forms. The artist, Hokusai, applies an impressionistic style to underline the mutable, fluid essence of the river, in keeping with the Tholonic Model's emphasis on the ever-evolving nature of awareness. The ink medium reflects the delicate balance between strength and vulnerability inherent in navigating life's challenging depths, echoing the implications of the Thologram's principles of limitation and contribution. All elements unite to convey the hexagram's core message of resilience and adaptability in the face of persisting challenges.
