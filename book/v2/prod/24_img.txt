"Return" is artistically brought to life in this image through the powerful portrayal of a phoenix rising from intertwined roots. The phoenix's upward flight symbolizes the renewing energy of the hexagram, embodying new beginnings and potential, while the intricate roots represent a stable base that allows for transformation and growth. The interplay of both elements highlights the balance between chaos and structure. The recurring triadic relationship within the composition signifies the integral principles of negotiation, limitation, and contribution that permeate Hexagram 24. Thus, this depiction underscores the inevitable cycle of rebirth that comes from embracing the ebb and flow of existence.
