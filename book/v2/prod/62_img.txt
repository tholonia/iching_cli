"Incremental Progress" is powerfully embodied in Fan Kuan's watercolor painting featuring a bird, a universal symbol of freedom and higher perspectives. The bird, ascending progressively with each wingbeat, mirrors the concept of growth through consistent, manageable steps, offering a visual representation of the delicate balance between movement and stillness in the pursuit of advancement. The choice of watercolor as a medium reflects the fluid and interconnected nature of the Thologram where awareness and intention shape reality. The piece, treated with a realism style, also portrays the meticulousness of small actions that lead to transformation, honouring the concept of universal love through every detail.
