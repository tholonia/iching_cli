"'Progression' is aptly represented through an artistic image featuring an oak tree, portrayed in the realism style and medium of oil painting, attributed to Vincent Van Gogh. The oak tree symbolizes gradual and strong growth, reflecting the tholonic principle of awareness manifesting in steady development. The realism style encapsulates the tangible aspect of growth signifying the fine balance within a Thologram. Oil paintings' enduring nature alludes to the timelessness of progression, while Van Gogh's style resonates with the emotional depth of organic growth, embodying universal love's creative energy in the Tholonic Model. Together, these elements paint an evocative picture of steady, natural progression.
