"Enthusiasm" is beautifully captured in an image of thunder emerging from the earth, rendered in vivid stained glass. The dynamic interaction of colors and patterns embody the hexagram's core theme of enthusiasm, symbolizing the pulsating energy that incites movement and growth. This artistic medium reflects the intersection of inspiration (the thunder, or the surge of creative force) and the right conditions (the earth, or prepared circumstances), echoing the hexagram's principle of energetic potential manifested through readiness. Crafted by Tiffany, notorious for his proficiency in weaving emotion through light and color, the image compellingly depicts the potential of enthusiasm as it drives progress and unity.
