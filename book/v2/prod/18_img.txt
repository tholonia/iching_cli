"Restoration" is skillfully embodied in the artwork chosen for this hexagram, making use of detailed patterns and a consistent flow, much like the wind gently erodes the surface of a mountain to expose fresh layers. The image is designed to echo the Tholonic principle of limitation, with change unfolding steadily through persistence, symbolized by the repetitive and detailed texture patterns. The woodblock printing method used reflects timelessness, mirroring the enduring process of renewal. Consequently, this illustration tactfully epitomizes the steady, measured transformation integral to restoration, thereby capturing the essence of Hexagram 18.
