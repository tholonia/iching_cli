"Obscured Light" is symbolized in the meticulously chosen elements of this image, portraying hidden transformation exemplified by a chameleon. The chameleon embodies the principle of negotiation, seamlessly transitioning between visibility and invisibility, reflecting the constant adaptability inherent in awareness. Rendered in the style of surrealism to transcend the boundaries of conventional perception, the artwork delves into the Thologic model's complex exploration of existence. The influence of Georgia O'Keeffe, known for encapsulating the essence that surpasses the obvious, infuses the piece. The use of gouache brings out the dynamic interplay between the hexagram's traits of contribution and limitation, encouraging a profound understanding of the transformative processes within the physical and abstract realms.
