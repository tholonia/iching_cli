"Refinement" is beautifully portrayed in the carefully balanced elements of the image of a cloud shepherd directing the rain. The vision of the shepherd softly articulating the flow of nature echoes the tholonic principle of negotiation, underlining the emergence of coherence through balanced dynamism. The minimalist style and ink on parchment medium mirror the subtlety and intentional selectivity of the refinement process. Katsushika Hokusai's illustration reminds us of the steady dedication needed in the patient accumulation of small improvements that leads to meaningful transformation. This image poetically unifies the essence of restrained creation inherent in Hexagram 09.
