"Strategic Resistance" is pictorially represented by the choice of a mountain stream in a watercolor painting by Ansel Adams, which visually manifests the essence of transformation through adaptability in the face of obstacles or transformative barriers. The water stream symbolizes a persistent adaptable force that strategically resists the mountain’s constraint by finding alternative paths. The watercolour medium reflects the fluidity, spontaneity, and adaptability inherent in the Tholonic Model’s concept of strategic resistance. Ansel Adams' realistic style situates the abstract Tholonic concept in perceivable reality while his expertise infuses the scene with symbolism and depth, emblematic of strategic transformative processes amidst resistance.
