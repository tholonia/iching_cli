"Cultivation" is artfully depicted in Katsushika Hokusai's stirring oil painting of a mountain, chosen for its potent symbolism of controlled strength and enduring stability. The mountain embodies notions of disciplined growth and patient accumulation of energy, reflecting the heart of this hexagram's teachings. Hokusai's use of realistic techniques further illustrates the Tholonic principles of balanced negotiation and defined limitations. The use of oil paints adds depth and texture, conveying the interactive processes of integration and emergence. Through each meticulous stroke, Hokusai presents a visual representation of the Tholonic concept where individual elements contribute meaningfully to a larger system.
