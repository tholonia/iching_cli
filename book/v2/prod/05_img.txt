"Patience" is vividly embodied by the pack of wolves in this image, intended to illustrate collective readiness and the development necessary for growth. The wolves' stance signifies strategic waiting and harmony with their environment, echoing the tholonic negotiation principle where potential energy is properly managed through preparation. The painting's impressionistic brushwork encapsulates the dynamic energy of anticipation, highlighting the balance between waiting and the inevitability of action. The depicted interplay of patience and flow, emphasized through the medium of watercolor, is a fitting metaphor for Hexagram 5's central theme.
