"Momentum" is vividly depicted through the image of thunder and lightning, symbolizing the energetic peak and sudden illumination specific to this hexagram. The futurism style of the image captures the forward thrust and rapid transformation inherent to "Momentum", encapsulating the integration of past, present, and future potentials into reality. The digital painting medium perfectly mirrors the self-similar, recursive nature of the Thologram, reflecting the multidimensional creation process. By creatively invoking Picasso's innovative spirit and symbolic depth, the image aligns with the Tholonic concept of universal love as the driving force behind this emergent integration.
