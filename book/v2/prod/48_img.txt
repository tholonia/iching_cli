"Restoration" is reflected through the chosen image of an underwater coral nursery, an embodiment of renewal after depletion. The elements speak to the hexagram's themes of replenishment and maintenance; the coral symbolizes resource conservation, the nurturing water represents the gentle wind principle, and the sunlight highlights the energy cycle's ascendancy. The triadic relationship among these elements signifies the balance essential for the hexagram's representation. The image perfectly captures its restorative and nourishing nature, reminding us of the important and delicate balance between structure and fluidity necessary for life and evolution within any system.
