The image for Hexagram 64, "Before Completion," was chosen to represent the tension and potential in the final stages of transformation. The subject portrays a liminal moment where order is emerging but not yet fully realized, symbolizing the balance between chaos and resolution. The intricate patterns and layered elements reflect the interplay of definition, balance, and integration, emphasizing the dynamic nature of becoming. The style blends symbolic abstraction with a sense of motion, illustrating the ongoing process of refinement and the approach to completion. The medium, with its luminous and ethereal quality, conveys the ephemeral yet universal principles underlying this state, reminding viewers of the cyclical nature of transitions and the ever-present potential for new beginnings.
