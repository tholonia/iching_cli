"Equilibrium" is vividly captured in the image of a finely balanced marble sculpture, representing a mountain resting on Earth. This design captures Hexagram 15's core concept of harmony and proper restraint, embodying the tholonic element of limitation wherein structure and balance arise from set boundaries. The balanced, minimalist style and clear natural lines of the sculpture depict the simplicity and clarity of equilibrium, capturing the interplay of opposing forces. Drawing inspiration from Polykleitos' precision and respect for proportion, the sculpture beautifully enshrines a profound sense of harmony, perfectly characterizing equilibrium as a vital requirement for growth and stability.
