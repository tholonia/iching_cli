"'Depletion' is evocatively represented through an array of striking contrasts and elements drawn from nature, reflecting its profound concepts and themes. The gnarled, withered branches encapsulate the essence of limitation and scarcity, while the ethereal, abstract forms above suggest the potential for renewal and adaptation. This triad of grounded roots and suspended forms embody the conflict and synergy between depletion and conservation, mirroring the illuminating transformation achieved through endurance. The stark contrasts portray a dynamic relationship, where resilience and strategic adaptation coexist amidst scarcity, thereby visualising the integral notions of this hexagram.
