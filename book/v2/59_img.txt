"Dissolution" is portrayed through an imagery that beautifully captures the transformation from solid to fluid states. The merging of solid and liquid forms in the image signifies the transformative nature of dissolution, while also portraying how structure evolves into new possibilities, akin to ice melting into water. The freely flowing water represents the creation of new paths, reflecting the hexagram's attribute of breaking down barriers. The harmonious interaction of land, water, and sky brings forth the interconnected nature of the Thologram, underlining dissolution as a critical process in evolution. This image encapsulates the dynamic interrelationship between different elements as guided by the principle of emergent dynamics.
