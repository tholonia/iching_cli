"Resonance" is artistically symbolized through the image of thunder over a lake, bringing together opposing and powerful forces in a harmonious dance. The fluid lines and vibrant contrasts in the image represent the negotiation principle of the Tholonic Model, signifying the essence of harmonious interaction between energies. The intertwining branches and clouds embody the intricate and dynamic balance of energies that form natural harmony through the power of resonance. The watercolor on silk medium chosen enhances the ethereal softness of the artwork, reflecting the fluid nature of negotiation and adaptation in forming patterns of natural resonance.
