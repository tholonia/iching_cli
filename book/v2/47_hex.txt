"Depletion" is an archetypal representation of a period of scarcity or lack, where resources are dwindling and circumstances are challenging. In the universe, we see this in the cycles of nature, such as a lake during a drought or the waning phase of the moon. In the world, it could be seen during an economic recession, or a period of war when resources are scarce and must be managed wisely. On a personal level, it might be experienced during a time of financial struggle, emotional exhaustion, or illness. This is a period that demands resilience, careful management of resources, and the ability to maintain core integrity despite the difficulties faced.

In the Tholonic model, "Depletion" is seen as a call to exercise *negotiation* and *limitation*. It's a time when the interconnected nature of existence is under strain, and the challenge is to adapt and endure while maintaining essential functions. This requires careful *contribution* of resources, ensuring that the essential aspects of existence are maintained while unnecessary expenditures are curtailed. It's a period that demands careful *negotiation* of resources and a strategic approach to manage scarcity. The success in this period is achieved through maintaining a positive outlook and showing resilience in the face of adversity.
