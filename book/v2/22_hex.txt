"Authentic Expression" represents the manifestation of one's true self through conscious refinement and sincere presentation. It's an image of inner truth radiating outward, much like a mountain illuminated by fire. We see this archetype in the universe when stars reveal their core elements through their radiant light. In the world, we see it in a skilled artist whose work reveals their inner truth, and in ourselves, we see it when we express our deepest selves through our words, actions, and creations. The challenge and the beauty of "Authentic Expression" lie in aligning our outer expressions with our inner truth.

In tholonic terms, "Authentic Expression" can be seen as the *contribution* of our deepest awareness to the world. It's the result of a *negotiation* between our inner truth and the external forms we use to express it. The *limitation* here is the requirement for conscious refinement and sincerity in our presentation. But within this limitation lies the potential for a unique and authentic expression of our awareness. It's a reminder that our true self is not merely what we show to the world, but what we reveal when we illuminate our inner mountain.
