"Radiance" is illustrated through a striking image marked by a shining central light source, intricate swirling patterns, and vast encompassing space. This image was chosen to encapsulate the core essence of the hexagram - the intermingling of conscious awareness and creative force, akin to sunlight illuminating the sky. The art's triadic composition signifies the outcome born from the union of these two elements, emerging as order. With balance portrayed through the harmonious blend of distinct forms within a fluid expanse, this aptly supports the notion of dynamic equilibrium fundamental to the hexagram. This visual representation elegantly elucidates the transformative potential of the conscious mind to enlighten and harmonize existence.
