Rather than attempting to build the entire Great Wall at once, his chief architect adopted a remarkable strategy. Instead of mobilizing all available workers for a single massive project, the construction was divided into smaller, manageable sections. Local teams worked on fortifying existing walls and connecting segments, using materials readily available in each region. This methodical approach allowed workers to learn from each section's challenges, adapting techniques for different terrains. The wall grew steadily, each completed section strengthening the whole. While Qin didn't live to see the wall's completion, his systematic approach established the foundation for what would become one of humanity's greatest architectural achievements. The wall continued to be built this way through multiple dynasties, with each generation adding and improving upon previous work. This method proved so effective that by the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), when the wall reached its final form, many of the original Qin sections still served as the foundation.",
