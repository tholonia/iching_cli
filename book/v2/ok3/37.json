Under Cosimo de' Medici's leadership, Florence operated through an intricate system of familial alliances. The Medici maintained order not through direct rule but by carefully balancing relationships with four other prominent families - the Albizzi, Strozzi, Pazzi, and Acciaiuoli. Each family had its defined role: the Medici handled banking and politics, the Strozzi managed trade, the Albizzi maintained military strength, while the Pazzi and Acciaiuoli provided diplomatic connections. Through this structured system of mutual support and clearly defined responsibilities, Florence experienced its golden age. This period saw unprecedented economic growth and cultural achievement, producing works by Botticelli, Michelangelo, and da Vinci. The system demonstrated how clear roles within a larger family structure could create stability and prosperity.",
