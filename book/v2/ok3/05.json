It split the bamboo target at such a precise angle that it revealed a hidden mark of treachery - a concealed blade meant to assassinate the Emperor during the victory ceremony.\n\nHis apparent inaction had been constant observation, each moment of waiting filled with growing certainty.

Instead, he chose a path of strategic waiting - gathering intelligence, preparing multiple response options, and carefully timing the US reaction.\n\nFor thirteen days, while hawks in his cabinet pushed for air strikes, Kennedy maintained a posture of active preparation. He secretly recorded strategy sessions, consulted diverse viewpoints, and developed a naval quarantine plan. Each day of waiting allowed for better intelligence, more prepared responses, and crucially, time for diplomatic back-channels to operate.\n\nThis period of high-stakes anticipation proved crucial. The careful gathering of photographic evidence made the case internationally. The time spent gaming out scenarios helped avoid catastrophic miscalculations. When Kennedy finally announced the quarantine, every piece was in place for a measured response that gave the Soviets room to withdraw without humiliation.\n\nThe crisis demonstrated how strategic waiting, filled with intensive preparation, could be more powerful than immediate action. Kennedy's patient but ready posture created the conditions for a resolution that avoided nuclear war.",
