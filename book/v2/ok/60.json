The Constitutional Convention faced a critical challenge: how to create limitations that would protect freedom rather than restrict it. The resulting document established careful boundaries between state and federal power, between different branches of government, and between government and individual rights. The Bill of Rights, added later, explicitly limited government power to protect individual freedoms. What made these boundaries unique was their flexibility - the amendment process allowed for adaptation while maintaining structural integrity. Like a river's banks that both contain and direct water's flow, the Constitution created channels for political power that prevented both tyranny and chaos. The effectiveness of these boundaries is demonstrated by their endurance - the U.S. Constitution remains the oldest written national constitution still in use.",
