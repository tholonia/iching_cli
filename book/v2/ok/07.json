Families with young children coordinated with medical units. Skilled workers organized tool-sharing networks. Even the daily water line became a self-regulating system, with groups taking turns managing distribution.\n\nWhen government inspectors arrived expecting to find another refugee crisis, they instead discovered a model of emergent order.

At its peak, this shipyard could produce a fully equipped merchant or military vessel every day - a feat that wouldn't be matched until the Industrial Revolution centuries later.\n\nThe Arsenal pioneered assembly-line production, with ships moving through distinct manufacturing stages. Raw materials entered at one end, proceeding through standardized construction phases. Different teams specialized in specific tasks - rope makers, sail makers, carpenters, caulkers - each working in designated areas with specialized tools.\n\nMost remarkably, the Arsenal developed standardized parts and modular construction methods. Ships were built using interchangeable components, with timber pre-cut to standard dimensions. The facility maintained detailed inventories and sophisticated supply chains, ensuring materials arrived precisely when needed.\n\nThis organizational mastery extended beyond production. The Arsenal employed thousands of workers in a highly structured hierarchy, from skilled artisans to administrators. During wartime, it could rapidly shift from commercial to military production, demonstrating extraordinary flexibility within its ordered system.",
