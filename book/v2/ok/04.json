The novice sees nothing in the full board.\" Through that one pawn, he revealed chess not as a game of pieces, but of understanding space and time.\n\nYears later, when Ivan became champion, he would say his greatest game was the one played with a single pawn.",

Rather than following traditional textbooks, he developed what became known as \"The Feynman Lectures on Physics,\" starting with fundamental questions about how nature behaves.\n\nInstead of presenting physics as a set of formulas to memorize, Feynman guided students through the process of discovery. He used simple, vivid examples – explaining quantum mechanics through double-slit experiments, or angular momentum through spinning plates. Complex concepts emerged naturally from basic principles and observation.\n\nMost revolutionary was his insistence that students learn through questioning rather than acceptance. When a student asked why magnets repel, Feynman famously spent an entire lecture exploring why \"why\" questions are deep and complex, teaching not just physics but how to think about physics.\n\nThe lectures proved so influential that they were published and continue to guide physics education today, demonstrating how effective teaching requires not just knowledge but the ability to lead students through their own discovery process.",
