Half the kids held their bats like fishing poles, the others threw the ball like they were feeding chickens. But Tom, who'd studied every newspaper clipping about the game, kept at it. He painted bases on flour sacks, used his ma's pie tins to show fielding positions.\n\nBy summer's end, when they played their first real game against the kids from Marion County, they might not have looked pretty, but they played real baseball.

Presper Eckert began work on ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer), facing seemingly insurmountable challenges. With no precedent for electronic computing, every step required invention. The basic problem of reliable vacuum tubes alone seemed impossible – the machine would need 18,000 of them to work perfectly in sync.\n\nThe team faced ridicule from skeptics who claimed electronic computing was impossible at such a scale. Each challenge demanded innovative solutions: new circuits had to be designed, novel programming methods developed, and cooling systems invented. The women programmers, including Jean Jennings and Betty Snyder, had to create entirely new mathematical methods as they went.\n\nThe project endured material shortages, technical setbacks, and constant skepticism. When finally unveiled in 1946, ENIAC occupied 1,800 square feet and consumed 150 kilowatts of power. Though it came too late for its intended wartime purpose, ENIAC proved electronic computing was possible, setting off the computer revolution.",
