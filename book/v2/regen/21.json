By harnessing the very light that scorched the land, Nathaniel sought not just energy but enlightenment.\n\nThe mirrors were his reminder of an earlier time, artifacts from a childhood dream ignited by his father's tales of solar utopias. Yet, the sun was a capricious ally, its heat both ally and adversary, demanding reverence and resilience. As the day progressed, his contraption heaved and groaned, the metal straining against its earthly anchor.\n\nThen came the moment he had awaited\u2014the fateful convergence.
