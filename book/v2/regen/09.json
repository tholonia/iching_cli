Rather than attempting dramatic modernization, he focused on the power of small, continuous improvements - a practice called 'kaizen'.\n\nInstead of installing expensive new equipment, Ohno encouraged workers to make tiny adjustments to their processes daily. Production line employees could stop the line to suggest improvements, no matter how minor. Each suggestion was taken seriously, tested, and if successful, immediately implemented.\n\nThe results seemed negligible at first - a few seconds saved here, a small reduction in waste there. But these improvements compounded. Workers began noticing inefficiencies they'd previously overlooked. The factory floor became a laboratory of continuous refinement, with every employee engaged in the process of improvement.\n\nBy 1965, this philosophy of small accumulation had transformed Toyota from a struggling local manufacturer into a global competitor. The company's production system became legendary for its efficiency, not through dramatic innovation but through the patient accumulation of countless small improvements.\n\nWhat made this approach revolutionary was its sustainability - while dramatic changes often met resistance, small improvements were readily accepted and integrated. The practice spread beyond manufacturing into healthcare, education, and government, demonstrating how gentle, persistent refinement could transform entire systems.",
