# V: Mathematical Foundations of the Tholonic I Ching

## Tholonic Recursion and Emergence of Transcendence


Let us begin at the simplest point imaginable of **N=1**, which represents the singular essence of Awareness and Intention, a unity symbolizing the initial state of *Negotiation*, from which all differentiation emerges.

From this initial state, the Tholonic recursion expands along three functional and philosophical axes:

- **Definition (Limitation)** – the structure, boundaries, and internal order.
- **Contribution (Integration)** – interaction, connection, and form.
- **Instantiation** – the creation resulting from the interplay of *Definition* and *Contribution*.

As previously shown, in the Tholonic model, these concepts can be represented as three points forming a triad. This arrangement results in three vector axes, each representing the movement, process, or nature of the interactions occurring between any two points.

An intriguing challenge when examining these interactions is determining whether they occur progressively over time or simultaneously. The Tholonic perspective suggests that these interactions happen both simultaneously and temporally. A conceptual illustration of this is how we can simultaneously imagine all numbers, yet we can only instantiate them sequentially. This parallels the difference between an archetype and its manifested forms.

A more tangible example would be the Big Bang, where the total sum of all energy in existence was instantaneously released as pure energy. Within approximately 10^-42^ seconds after that instant, the four fundamental forces of nature (gravity, electromagnetism, the strong nuclear force, and the weak nuclear force) were unified. From that unified quantum field of pure energy and fundamental forces emerged particles, which gave rise to nuclei and atoms, eventually leading to stars, planets, life, and everything else that currently exists. Here we have the simultaneous creation of everything at the instant of the Big Bang and the temporally ordered sequence of events that followed.

Applying these ideas to the triad, we can say that teh complete triad exists sumultaniously, and it’s instantes exist tempoirally.

Looking at the process temporally, the interactions between *Negotiation/Balance* moving to *Definition/Limitation*, or 1 moving to 2, is represented by the line that connects N and D.  As a process, this line represent the change from infinite to finite, from one to many, from whole to division. In the context of *Form and Function*, this is the *Form*; what something *is*.

The interaction between C and N, or *Contribution/Integration* moving toward *Negotiation/Balance*, is where the many recreate the one, where the parts contribute back to the whole from which they originally arose. We see this clearly in how living organisms, and indeed all matter, eventually return to the elements from which they were created, just as the Universe itself will ultimately return to the void from which it emerged. This is fundamentally a process of sacrifice, giving back, and death, which can also be understood as another form of recycling. In this sense, this process inherently involves division and separation.  In the context of *Form and Function*, this is the *Function*; what something *does*.

The process of interaction between D and C, between 2 and 3, is the seat of creation, as this is where what something *is* and what what something *does* meet, where *Form* and *Function* unite to create a pattern which has the potential to perpetuate itself, just like the parent that is was crated within. Unlike the divisive nature of the other two vectors, this vector is one of multiplying and adding, making it the process of creation by definition. 

In short, the axes of *Definition* and *Contribution* arise through division (unity splitting into duality), while *Instantiation* emerges via addition and subtraction (recombination into unity).

As a simultaneous creation, where 1,  2,  and 3 come into existence together, we can say that 6 is the value of the triad.  As a process of creation, 6 instantiates as 1, 2, and 3.  In other words, 6 is the *holon* and 1, 2, and 3 are the *partons*. It is no coincidence that 6 is the first “perfect number”, which is when a number whose factors (excluding itself) add up precisely to the number itself.  Ancient cultures and philosophers (such as the Greeks and Pythagoreans) considered perfect numbers to represent harmony, balance, and completeness due to their unique numerical characteristics. 

Perfect numbers are quite rare, and only 51 have been discovered to date. Here are the first eight:
 6, 28, 496, 8128, 33550336, 8589869056, 137438691328, and 2305843008139952128.

In addition, 6 is the factorial of 3, written as 3! (1 × 2 × 3 = 6), making 6 the only number known to be both a perfect number and a factorial number.

Thus, it is not surprising that the progression from 2 to 3 mirrors the process established by their parent 6, which generates 2 and 3 through division.

Assigning the values 1, 2, and 3 to the points of the triad is based on using natural numbers, that is, counting numbers, which exclude 0. This makes sense if we view the triad in the context of the instantiated world, the world of tangible existence. However, when considering archetypes, we should use the set of whole numbers, which includes every integer starting from zero: 0, 1, 2, 3, …., because zero (0) represents the unmanifested or potential state, which precedes any tangible existence. Thus, it naturally aligns with archetypal concepts.

By using whole numbers, we reveal an even more fundamental or archetypal pattern. Assigning the values 0, 1, and 2 to the triad points brings the total value of the triad to 3, clearly illustrating this deeper structure especially given that the number 3 is universally recognized as symbolic of fundamental processes of creation, balance, and manifestation.

To ensure that every combination of points across all generations results in a unique numeric value, each point is assigned a distinct power of two. For example, numbering the *NDC* points as 0, 1, and 2, their assigned values are $2^0 = 1$, $2^1 = 2$, and $2^2 = 4$, respectively. Consequently, each line connecting two points will also yield a unique sum, as illustrated below:

<center><img src='../Images/arxiv-tritest.png' style='width:80%'/></center>

This results in the following three vectors:

- **Negotiation–Definition (*<u>ND</u>*)**: (32 + 2 + 1) = 35 = 7×5
- **Definition–Contribution (*<u>DC</u>*)**: (8 + 4 + 2) = 14 = 7×2
- **Contribution–Negotiation (<u>*CN*</u>)**: (16 + 4 + 1) = 21 = 7×3

Because all of these values are multiples of 7, we can just use the multiplier to represent the the value of the line, hence:

- *<u>ND</u>* = 5 (Definition/Limitation)
- *<u>DC</u>* = 2 (Instantiation)
- *<u>CN</u>* = 3 (Contribution/Integration)

## Tholonic Identity



What happens when we apply these numbers recursively, given that the Tholonic model is one of recursion?  First off, how would we even do that?  One way, which is the most obvious, is to start with *unity* (1), add $\frac{unity}{Limitation}$ because a new instance is being created from *unity*, then subtract $\frac{unity}{Contribution}$ because that instance is being returned to *unity*.

For example, 

$1 + \frac{1}{5} - \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.8\overline{666}$

Now we have a fingerprint value for the first tholon.  At first glance, it seems like a very common value, with no special meaning or profound mathematical significance. It’s even a bit disappointing in the non-uniqueness.  Nevertheless, it is a unique value, and therefore, a valid *Tholonic Identity* value.

We can then do this the the child tholon as well, and for each generation that follows, ad infinitum.  For each generation, the values are increased by the value of the axis of instantiation, which is 2, or the spectrum across which they interact to create a new tholon, and that value is 2.  

For example, point *D* carries the value 2 and point *C* carries the value 4. Their sum is 6, which—as we have already seen—forms the triad that begins with 1: the triad of the instantiated world, the realm of the natural numbers that arises from the archetypal triad of all numbers.

Most importantly, the archetypal value of *Contribution* is 2² = 4. It is relevant to point out that 4 = 2^2^ because 2 is not only the value of the instantiation axis (the horizontal cyan line in the diagrams), it is also the only axis that appears twice in every triad because it spans the interval between *D* and *C* and marks the point where the next *N* emerges.

For this reason, each new generation adds 4 to both *D* and *C*, transforming the initial 5 and 3 of the first generation into 9 and 7 in the next.

Now, if we continue with out simple formula for each each generation, we end up with something that is quite remarkable… &pi; !!



## The Recursive Path Toward π: Explicit Steps


Let’s explicitly explore the recursion's first steps approaching π:

**First Child (Parent=1, Limitation=5, Contribution=3):**

$1 + \frac{1}{5} - \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.8\overline{666} \quad\rightarrow\quad \times 4 = 3.4\overline{666}$

**Second Child (Parent=0.8667, Limitation=9, Contribution=7):**

$0.8667 + \frac{1}{9} - \frac{1}{7} \approx 0.8\overline{349206} \quad\rightarrow\quad \times 4 = 3.3\overline{396825}$

**Third Child (Parent=0.8349206, Limitation=13, Contribution=11):**

$0.8349206 + \frac{1}{13} - \frac{1}{11} \approx 0.8\overline{209346} \quad\rightarrow\quad \times 4 = 3.2\overline{837384}$

Each iteration moves closer to $\frac{\pi}{4}$, infinitely refining toward transcendence.

Below (left) is a traditional recursion tree, where each new child expands externally from the parent.  On the right, is the tholonic recursion tree, where each new child expands internally.

## How π Emerges from Perfect Squares: The Mathematical Proof


We arrived at the values for *Definition* and *Contribution* and Instantiation using the pure and simple math of 2^0^, 2^1^, 2^2^ for the outer vertices and 2^3^, 2^4^, 2^5^ for the inner vertices, and then applying the value of the multiplier that produces the sums of each vector. We then incremented *Definition* and *Contribution* by 4, which seems reasonable as both vectors start at 2 and end at 2, but given that squaring a value is the very act of self-similar, self-definition through self-referential perfect symmetry, 2^2^, which is the first perfect square exponentiation, is clearly the perfect formula. Likewise, on the *Contribution*/*Integration* side, addition, a word synonymous with contribution and integration, is clearly the path.

This results in the series 5,3,9,7,13,11,… and so on. When comparing this to the classic Leibniz series for π: $\frac{\pi}{4} = 1 - \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{5} - \frac{1}{7} + \frac{1}{9} - \dots$ we can easily see that the tholonic series is essentially identical, only expressed differently as the Tholonic approach explicitly rearranges the terms into distinct pairs (tholons) as follows: $\pi_{Tholonic} = 4 [ (((1 + (\frac{1}{5}-\frac{1}{3})) + (\frac{1}{9}-\frac{1}{7})) + (\frac{1}{13}-\frac{1}{11})) + \dots ]$

Notice the subtle but critical rearrangement:


With this arrangement we can see fascinating numeric relationship from the recursion's axes:

- $Definition × Contribution = 16(n²) - 1$

This remarkable relationship explicitly connects π directly to perfect squares (n²):

| n    | Definition | Contribution | Product (D × C) | Perfect Square Relation |
| ---- | ---------- | ------------ | --------------- | ----------------------- |
| 1    | 3          | 5            | **15**          | (4 × 1²) - 1            |
| 2    | 7          | 9            | **63**          | (4 × 2²) - 1            |
| 3    | 11         | 13           | **143**         | (4 × 3²) - 1            |
| …    | …          | …            | …               | …                       |

Each recursion explicitly contributes finer and finer resolution to the value of π through perfect squares, uniquely highlighting π’s transcendental nature emerging from balanced, internal structural complexity.

In addition, this series of perfect squares is itself self similar, as as can see when we plot the first 10, 100, and 1000 perfect squares, all of which produce the same curve.

<center><img src='../Images/curve-H.png' style='width:80%'/></center>

This fractal pattern embodies philosophically profound ideas—self-similarity, infinite recursion, and interconnectedness throughout reality, from microscopic cells to cosmic galaxies. Each recursion reflects the same truth at every scale, a symbolic unity in multiplicity.



## Introducing Generational Complexity


The uniqueness of this fingerprint is due sol to the incremental adjustments in each recursion. We refer to this incremental value as *Generational Complexity* because each recursive iteration carries forward structural and relational information from preceding iterations, accumulating linearly—analogous to wisdom passed down through generations, genetic or epigenetic inheritance, or the collective knowledge within a morphic field. Each new instance is thus structurally richer, inheriting and building upon the layered definition and integration of its ancestors.

Each recursive step represents a philosophical interplay:

$\text{Child} = \text{Parent} + \frac{1}{\text{Definition}} - \frac{1}{\text{Contribution}}$

The *Limiting term* of  $\frac{1}{\text{D}}$ is limiting only to the parent *N* and is additive to the child *D*, which is also a contribution to to child instantiation. It expands the spectrum upon which a new instance takes form, thus acting as a constructive force adding to the instance’s definition.

The *Contributing term* of $\frac{1}{\text{C}}$ is subtractive, as *C* as it represents the child instance giving of itself toward something greater (the parent), much in the same way that *N* gave of itself to create *D*.  In this sense, $\frac{1}{\text{C}}$ is to the child instance what $\frac{1}{\text{D}}$ is to the parent.  These functions symbolize the child instance’s relational role within a larger holarchy, functioning both as a *holon* (whole entity) and a *parton* (contributing parts), embodying autonomy and participation simultaneously.

Since these operations occur along the instantiating *<u>DC</u>* axis (value = 2), subsequent generations evolve by this factor, yet are expressed differently for each term.

Notice carefully: both *Definition* (exponential) and *Contribution* (linear) axes produce the numeric value of  4, yet their symbolic paths are significantly distinct:

- **Limitation/Definition** is an exponential growth, symbolizing internal reflection, reinforcing self-contained structural complexity.

- **Contribution/Integration** is a linear growth (2 × 2), symbolizing external connection, interaction, and integration: one entity joined with another.

The reasoning behind this choice can be justified philosophically, logically, structurally, and metaphysically, but mathematically, it arises because *Definition* must reference itself to establish identity, naturally suggesting exponentiation as the representation of this self-interaction. This self-similar expansion is internal since *Definition* has no external point of reference apart from its parent (because *Contribution* follows *Definition*), which is unity (1) and thus neutral.

In contrast, *Contribution’s* linear multiplication (2 × 2) explicitly represents the integration of distinct external entities. Furthermore, the generational complexity (*G*) increases (via contribution) through a multiplicative function that joins distinct values, described mathematically as:  $G(n) = 2\times 2\times n$, the first 2 is the value of the source axis and the second 2 is the value of the destination axis, and the *n* the the instance of recursion.

##### Note: This idea is further supported when we look at the section below called “*Mathematical Proof: Generating π from Tholonic Recursion Using Perfect Squares*”, where we arrive at &pi; by first squaring every integer starting with 1, they multiply that by 0.5.

Here, we have two kinds of growth: 

- 

- 

Exponential growth, which we can associate Euler’s number *e*, 2.71828, which is the base of natural exponential growth, and implicitly, logarithms, which are the inverse of exponential growth. Symbolically, exponential growth is like the deepening of understanding, the expansion inward. It multiples itself by itself, symbolizing how we build internal structure, reinforcing our core essence through reflection and internal recursion. This exponential growth is the symbolic foundation of *Definition/Limitation*, for definition and boundaries define what something is, including ourselves. Thus, as this inward process of self-organization advances, internal restrictions naturally deepen exponentially, reinforcing the metaphysical principle that perfection can be sought, but never realized.

Linear growth is monotonic and moves consistently in one direction. Linear growth is outward-reaching. multiplying itself by something else. Although numerically identical in the archetype of 2×2 vs. 2^2^, the philosophical difference is profound. This linear growth represents the *Contribution/Integration*, the act of integrating into the broader reality and connecting outwardly where results are measured in “output”.  

We see example of this in technology and nature. In computing performance, where incremental improvements require dramatically more resources, such as doubling processing speed that requires a quadrupling in research and development, or in AI and machine learning, where a few percentage points of improved accuracy might require doubling the size of the dataset.  

In nature, it even has a name; *allometric scaling* and *Kleiber's Law*, which describes how the larger the organism, plant or animal, the more resources it requites exponentially.

##### Note: For the record, there are actually four types of growth; linear (doubling the input doubles the resources), linearithmic (doubling the input slightly more than doubles the resources), polynomial (doubling the input quadruples or octuples the resources), and exponential (doubling the input causes an astronomical increase in resources).  the two types of grown in the Tholonic model presented above represent the two extremes, from minimum growth to maximum growth.

Together, these two kinds of growth, inward exponential (*Definition*) and outward linear (*Contribution*), and all those that fall between, are the heartbeat of creation. Each iteration of the recursion symbolizes a new generation, inheriting wisdom and complexity from its ancestors, adding layer upon layer, much like the transmission of knowledge, memory, culture, and genetics from parent to child.

From the interplay of these two types of growth emerges π itself. π is transcendence made manifest, a number that never fully completes itself, eternally elusive, infinitely refined. Each step we take brings us closer and closer to this ideal, yet it forever slips just beyond reach. This eternal approach toward π reminds us that perfection isn't a destination but an endless, beautiful journey toward understanding and refinement.

Notice, too, the astonishing self-similar pattern emerging from this recursion. The numbers repeat their essence at every scale, resonating deeply with the self-similar nature of reality itself. Like reflections in infinite mirrors, each recursive step mirrors the entire structure. This is perfectly symbolic of the idea that all of existence is fractal, repeating its truths in every corner and at every scale, whether atoms or galaxies, cells or civilizations.

Further still, consider how these numeric patterns align perfectly with the ancient wisdom of the I Ching. Each axis, *Definition*, *Contribution*, *Negotiation*, maps beautifully onto the binary symbolism of the hexagrams, reflecting timeless Taoist principles of harmony, duality, and balance. The ancient sages knew intuitively what the universe whispers mathematically.

Thus, the simple mathematics we've explored are more than numbers, they are sacred metaphors for life itself, encoded in symbols and equations. They teach us that reality emerges (*Negotiation*) from subtle imperfections, refined by continuous self-reflection (*Definition*) and integration (*Contribution*), forever striving toward unattainable perfection (π).

In knowing this, you hold the secret of life: to seek perfection is the essence of existence; never to reach it is its great wisdom.



## Perspective Matters: Parent and Child in Duality

With the Tholonic recursion method, we create a clear and structured pathway consisting of parent tholons and their child tholons. Numerous mathematical relationships support viewing this recursion as fundamentally composed of tholons, each embodying a triadic relationship between *Negotiation* (*N*), *Definition/Limitation* (*D*), and *Contribution* (*C*).  In our examples, we have been subtracting the value of *Definition* and adding the value of *Contribution*.  This is valid from the perspective of the instantiating instance (the child), but if we change the perspective for the parent, these functions are reversed.

To illustrate this clearly, let's consider reversing the mathematical operations. Instead of defining the child as…


$CHILD_{forward} = \left(PARENT + \frac{1}{D} - \frac{1}{C}\right)$

…we define it as:

$CHILD_{reverse} = \left(PARENT - \frac{1}{D} + \frac{1}{C}\right)$

Both of these formulas produce the exact same results, but the path to that result is different, and in this case, that has significance.

From the child's viewpoint, *Definition/Limitation* acts as a creative, enabling property that allows the tholon to instantiate itself, while *Contribution/Integration* acts as a reduction to the child , since *Contribution* represents what the child returns to its parent and environment. Conversely, from the parent's perspective, *Definition* reduces the parent, and *Contribution* enhances it. Crucially, from either viewpoint, *Definition/Limitation* must always precede *Contribution* temporally.

The images below visually illustrate this dynamic clearly. The parent triad on the left has its *<u>ND</u>* vector (blue-green) explicitly along the "5" axis.  After creating the child triad, the child also initially aligns its *<u>ND</u>* vector explicitly along the same "5" axis. However, in the center  diagram of the tetrahedral  map, we see the four triads mapped out clearly, and what was previously the parent's *<u>ND</u>* vector along the "5" axis now appears explicitly as the *<u>NC</u>* axis (blue-red), suggesting a shift toward *Contribution*.

<center><img src='../Images/order.png' style='width:80%'></center>

Yet this apparent contradiction resolves elegantly when we expand our view into three dimensions, forming a complete tetrahedron (right image). In this fully realized tetrahedral form, the two segments of the "5" axis merge into a single coherent vector. Simultaneously, the red (*C*), green (*D*), and blue (*N*) points merge into a unified fourth point, represented by the central white dot. What was originally the parent's blue *N*-state thus transforms into a new white *N*-state. This new white point inherently contains all RGB components and therefore simultaneously functions as *Negotiation* (*N*-blue) relative to the red and green corners, as *Contribution* (*C*-red) relative to the blue and green corners, and as *Definition* (*D*-green) relative to the blue and red corners.

When we combine both perspectives of *forward* and *reverse*, their sum converges exactly to $\frac{\pi}{2}$. Mathematically, this happens because the sum of the *forward* and *reverse* child values is always twice the parent value:

$CHILD_{\text{forward}} + CHILD_{\text{reverse}} = 2 \times PARENT$

Philosophically, this happens because the child is a child to its parent, but it is also a parent itself, resulting in two parents.

Conceptually, this result is ideal in Tholonic terms. A tholon, being inherently tetrahedral, requires the interaction of exactly one parent and one child to form a stable tetrahedral mapping. Each complete tetrahedral interaction thus naturally corresponds to a value of $\frac{\pi}{2}$ (which equated to 90&deg; in radians). Consequently, a fully realized tholon, which is comprised of both a *real* tholon and its *virtual* counterpart, produces as complete a value of &pi; (which equated to 180&deg; in radians) as it’s context and limits allow.

Interestingly, two tetrahedrons converge to &pi;, yet also create a perfect cube while &pi; defines the shape of a sphere. At first glance, the relationship between the tetrahedron, the cube, and the sphere seems ironic. A cube and a sphere are eternally separated by the transcendental π, proof that a perfect cube can never precisely transform into a perfect sphere. This impossibility arises because π, the constant defining the relationship between linear and curved geometries, is transcendental and irrational. Yet intriguingly, two tetrahedrons, each Tholonically valued at $\frac{\pi}{2}$, combine perfectly to form a cube, explicitly assigning to the cube a Tholonic value of π. Thus, even as two perfectly rational tetrahedrons merge seamlessly into a cube, their Tholonic identity encodes the inherent impossibility of its perfect transformation.\

##### Sidenote: The total degrees of a cube is 2160&deg;, which is an interesting value as it is 12&pi; radians, the number of years in an astrological age, the diameter of the moon, and clearly based on the the mysterious value of 216 reference to 216.  The total degrees in a tetrahedron is 720&deg;, so two tetrahedrons is 1440&deg;, which is also clearly based on the value of 144=12^2^, and this also tells us that the cube as exactly 1.5 times greater that two tetrahedrons, or to put the ratios in a different form: $\frac{two\ tetrahedrons}{cube}$ = $\frac{144}{216}$ = $\frac{2^2\times3}{2^2\times3^3}$ = $\frac{12^2}{6^3}$ = $\frac{2}{3}$ = $0.\overline{666}$.

However, beyond irony, this relationship offers profound philosophical insight. The value of a Tholonic tetrahedron, as revealed through this recursion process, symbolizes an infinite pursuit of **Perfection**, always approaching but never fully attaining it. This reflects precisely how a cube may infinitely approximate a perfect sphere but never fully become one, constrained eternally by π’s transcendental nature. Thus, the impossibility of perfection is intrinsically embedded within the Tholonic tetrahedron itself, reflecting the fundamental truth that perfection can be eternally approached but never fully realized.

Here, again, we see the same interplay of *Perfection*, *Refinement*, and *Growth* that was shown to us previously using the binary values of the vectors and vertices, as described above.

Ultimately, this recursive mathematical structure as well as the associated binary values reveals both mathematical elegance and deep philosophical wisdom, unifying ancient knowledge and modern insight into a coherent vision of existence which exposes some truths on life and reality:

- Perfection is eternally approached but never fully reached.
- Imperfection creates movement, growth, and infinite refinement.
- Existence thrives on the subtle interplay of internal reflection (*Limitation*) and external interaction (*Contribution*).
- Reality manifests through fractal, recursive self-similarity.
- Wisdom lies not in attaining perfection, but in the endless pursuit of refining oneself toward it.

## Binary Symbolism and the I Ching Connection


The symbolism inherent in this recursive process, which is based explicitly on exponents of 2, naturally corresponds to a binary system, making it deeply connected to the symbolism found in the I Ching, itself fundamentally binary in nature. This connection between the ancient wisdom of the I Ching and mathematical symbolism has a significant historical precedent. Rather than viewing the Tholonic I Ching as an entirely new concept, it should be seen as a direct continuation and expansion of earlier explorations, specifically the groundbreaking work of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, who himself studied the I Ching extensively.

Leibniz was first introduced to the I Ching in 1697 through correspondence with Father Joachim Bouvet, a French Jesuit missionary stationed in China. Bouvet's letters included detailed diagrams of the 64 hexagrams and explanations of their meanings. This correspondence allowed Leibniz to recognize immediately the remarkable alignment between the system of broken and unbroken lines used in the I Ching and the binary arithmetic system that he himself had independently developed several years earlier.

Leibniz was deeply fascinated by this discovery and elaborated on it in his influential essay, *Explication de l'Arithmétique Binaire* (1703). He regarded this discovery as profound evidence of a universal truth that transcended cultural boundaries. For Leibniz, it validated both his mathematical explorations and his broader philosophical and theological beliefs.

Indeed, Leibniz's binary system was fundamentally rooted in philosophical and theological ideas rather than purely practical mathematical applications. Leibniz perceived binary arithmetic as symbolic of divine creation itself. In his interpretation, the number "1" represented unity or God, and the number "0" represented nothingness. This binary opposition mirrored his philosophical conviction that God created everything out of nothing (*creatio ex nihilo*). Thus, Leibniz saw his binary arithmetic as the perfect mathematical representation of creation itself. This philosophical and theological dimension was central to Leibniz's thinking about binary arithmetic, which, at the time, had not yet found practical applications. It was only centuries later, through the works of figures like George Boole and Claude Shannon, that binary arithmetic became central to communications and  computing technology. For Leibniz himself, the binary system was primarily a philosophical and theological tool and a symbolic framework for understanding creation and illustrating the harmony between mathematics, philosophy, and religion.

In a letter to Duke Rudolf August of Brunswick in 1697, Leibniz explained clearly the spiritual essence of his binary arithmetic:

> *"The essence of my binary arithmetic is that I use no characters other than 0 and 1, and when reaching 2, I start again... This resembles creation ex nihilo, because all numbers are created from 1 and 0, just as all beings are created by God (the Unity) from nothing."*

The Tholonic I Ching presented here aims explicitly to formalize and further develop the insights that Leibniz initially realized. It is profoundly significant, and not coincidental, that the Tholonic recursion method presented here uses Leibniz’s series to calculate π, simultaneously reflecting deep symbolic relationships with the I Ching. This remarkable alignment represents a significant step in bridging the gap between metaphysics and physics, philosophy and mathematics, intuition and rigorous computation.

Below is one such clear illustration of this profound connection.

## The Connection


Remarkably, the numeric values of the three axes, 35, 14, and 21, along with the value of the resultant center triad (56), perfectly align with the binary symbolic language of the I Ching. Each numeric axis corresponds philosophically to hexagram pairs representing universal dualities, *balance, definition, integration*, encoded millennia ago.

The table presented shows the 64 I Ching hexagrams arranged in binary order as 32 distinct pairs, each pair embodying opposing yet complementary aspects of a single conceptual theme. Significantly, the first two pairs of *Primordial Duality* and *Cycle of Influence* (or *scope*), represent the fundamental axis bridging the two primary classes of hexagrams (*ascending* and *descending*). These two initial pairs function collectively as one profound foundational concept, setting the stage for the entire recursive symbolic structure.

Highlighted clearly within the table are the specific pairs that correspond directly to the axes explicitly identified in the Tholonic map: *Growth (Increase–Duration)*, *Perfection (Before Completion–After Completion)*, and *Refinement (Decrease–Influence)*. These three pairs precisely define the starting points of the Tholonic recursion process. Even more striking than their symbolic alignment with the recursion is their remarkably uniform distribution, perfectly dividing the hexagrams into symmetrical segments of seven stages each—reflecting deep numerical, philosophical, and metaphysical coherence.

<center><img src='../Images/32pairs-4.png' style='width:100%'/></center>



We can clearly see the relationship between the Parent and *Definition* axes symbolically represented by the hexagram pair 41䷨*~35~* *Decrease* (reduction, sacrifice) and 31䷞*~28~* *Influence* (harmonious joining) which, as previously noted, aligns perfectly with the underlying mathematics. This vector corresponds precisely to the path of *Refinement* that these two hexagrams embody, allowing us to state explicitly that refinement itself is fundamentally an act of definition and limitation.

The vector connecting Parent to *Contribution* aligns with the path of *Perfection*, represented by the archetypal hexagrams 63䷾*~21~* *After Completion* (balance, order, and harmony that has been successfully achieved), symbolizing the ideal of perfection, and its counterpart, 64䷿*~42~* *Before Completion* (transitioning to balance, order, and harmony), symbolizing the continual striving toward that ideal. These two hexagrams thus represent the complete spectrum of perfection, from aspiration to attainment.

Further, the vector linking *Definition* and *Contribution*, which, according to the Tholonic model, symbolizes the spectrum across which new instances of creation are instantiated, thus aptly named the axis of instantiation, corresponds directly to the path of *Growth*. This path is specifically defined by the hexagram pair 32䷟*~14~* *Duration* (stability, sustainability, endurance) and 42䷩*~49~* *Increase* (growth, expansion), providing as explicit and clear a definition of growth as can be found within the symbolic language of the I Ching.

At the heart of these interactions lies the central triad, embodying the path of  *Equilibrium*, which we can also interpret as the *Balanced Path*.

This idea that the “way” or the “passage” is one of balance is reflected in the ancient truths of Buddhism’s *Middle Way*, Confucianism's *Doctrine of the Mean*, Ancient Greek’s *Golden Mean*, Taoism’s *wu-wei*, Islam’s *wasatiyyah*, Judaism's *shvil hazahav*, and in many indigenous traditions.  Here, we’ll refer to the *Path of Equilibrium* as simply *The Passage*.

The Passage symbolizes the authentic and balanced way forward, represented powerfully by the cardinal pair of hexagrams 11䷊*~7~* *Peace* (balance, integration, flourishing) and 12䷋*~56~* *Standstill* (obstruction, blockage, disharmony).



## The Passage


The message of the *Path of Equilibrium* is clear: when Heaven and Earth unite harmoniously, peace arises; when they separate, stagnation inevitably follows.

In Tholonic terms, this profound insight reveals that when consciousness and intention focus on integrating the perfect archetype with its imperfect instances, in other words, seeing the perfection inherent within imperfection, Awareness and Intention manifest as growth via peace and harmony. Conversely, when consciousness and intention focus instead on separating the perfect archetype from its imperfect manifestations, that is, dwelling upon imperfection or lack, Awareness and Intention manifest as stagnation via disharmony and disintegration.

## Mathematical Proof: Generating π from Tholonic Recursion Using Perfect Squares


This section added simply to provide the mathematical proof that the Tholonic recursion converges to &pi;.

Consider the Tholonic recursive definition explicitly stated as follows:

$N_{k+1} = N_k + \frac{1}{(4k + 1)} - \frac{1}{(4k - 1)}, \quad\text{where } N_1 = 1$

This formula can be rearranged clearly, explicitly grouping each iteration into independent triplets, known as *tholons*, emphasizing philosophical significance while maintaining mathematical accuracy:

$\frac{\pi}{4} = 1 + \left(\frac{1}{5} - \frac{1}{3}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{9} - \frac{1}{7}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{13} - \frac{1}{11}\right) + \dots$

Each iteration explicitly involves terms related to perfect squares. Observe carefully that the denominators of each pair (4n - 1, 4n + 1) multiplied yield a perfect square minus one:

$(4n - 1)(4n + 1) = 16n^2 - 1$

Thus, the denominators in every recursion step explicitly involve perfect squares (16n²) offset by unity. This represents a distinct mathematical identity and connects π explicitly and uniquely with perfect squares, something entirely novel compared to traditional series.

### First Iterations: Explicit Computational Steps

Clearly, the first four explicit recursion steps yield:

| k    | Recursive Term                            | Numerical Value (×4 ≈ π) |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| 1    | $1 + \frac{1}{5} - \frac{1}{3}$       | 3.4666667                |
| 2    | $\dots + \frac{1}{9} - \frac{1}{7}$   | 3.3396825                |
| 3    | $\dots + \frac{1}{13} - \frac{1}{11}$ | 3.2837384                |
| 4    | $\dots + \frac{1}{17} - \frac{1}{15}$ | 3.2523659                |

Each explicit recursion converges progressively toward π.

### Explicit Derivation from Perfect Squares

The remarkable relationship connecting perfect squares emerges explicitly through the denominators of the series:

$\frac{\pi}{4} = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{2}{16n^2 - 1}$

Expanding explicitly reveals the perfect squares clearly and directly:
$\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{2}{16(1)^2 - 1} + \frac{2}{16(2)^2 - 1} + \frac{2}{16(3)^2 - 1} + \dots$

This precise formula explicitly shows π emerging directly from the infinite sum involving perfect squares (16n²) offset by *unity*.

### Convergence Proof

To mathematically verify convergence explicitly, we recognize the general form as:
$\frac{\pi}{4} = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{2}{16n^2 - 1}$

or we could also write is as:

$\pi = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{8}{16n^2 - 1}$

Given that the series explicitly decreases monotonically and converges absolutely, it meets all conditions required for convergence by the alternating series test.

### Philosophical Implications Clearly Stated

Philosophically, each explicit iteration embodies:

- *Definition/Limitation* (represented by $4n+1$) positively defining structure.
- *Contribution/Integration* (represented by $4n-1$) symbolizing integration or return to the greater context.

The presence of perfect squares (16n²) symbolizes internal coherence, self-definition, and structural perfection. The subtraction of unity explicitly symbolizes the philosophical principle that creation occurs through slight imperfection—eternally approaching, yet never fully realizing perfection.

Thus, both the explicit mathematical derivation and profound philosophical symbolism are presented clearly, distinctly, and rigorously, making it ideally suited for a professional mathematical journal.

## A Philosophical Description of Emergent Transcendence


Given that we have associated properties and qualities to the values and forms, we can describe the emergence of &pi; is a purely philosophical manner, which would be something like the following:

Consider first the *perfect square*;  a perfect square, symbolically, represents absolute balance, inner harmony, completeness unto itself, a realm of pure internal order. Yet, intriguingly, the recursion we explore doesn't give us these perfect squares directly; instead, it always returns a perfect square *minus unity (1)*. Why should that be?

Herein lies the secret of life itself: the universe never manifests perfection outright, it always stops one step short. This small imperfection, the “-1”, is not a flaw, but the very essence of creation. It’s the subtle gap between the ideal and the real, the archetype and its material instance. Because perfection itself cannot exist in this world, this “-1” instead creates movement, growth, evolution towards perfection, a relentless striving to bridge that infinitesimal yet unbridgeable gap.

## To π and Beyond


The recursive Tholonic structure described for generating π is not limited to π alone. By simply adjusting the four input values and the line of logic this philosophical and mathematical process can generate other fundamental constants such as the Golden Ratio (φ,  1.6180339887), Euler’s number (*e*, 2.7182818285), the natural logarithm of 2 (ln(2)),  0.6931471806), and the square root of 2 (√2, 1.4142135623).

This capacity to generate diverse fundamental constants demonstrates that the Tholonic recursion isn’t just a specialized π calculator; it’s a generalized symbolic engine, capable of embodying multiple structural equilibria within mathematics. Each constant (π, φ, e, ln(2),√2) emerges naturally as a symbolic and numeric √2 representation of the specific philosophical dynamics of *Negotiation*, *Definition*, *Contribution*, and generational complexity that characterize its initial conditions.  

Listed below are the notations of values for *Negotiation*, *Definition*, *Contribution* as $N = \{D,C\}$ representing the value used to start the recursion.  

##### Note: for &pi;,  the value must be multiplied by 4, and for *e*, the integral value has to be divided by 4.

- **π, Pi**  *1={3,5}*:
  Represents the never-ending journey toward unattainable perfection. π symbolizes the perpetual gap between the archetype and the instance, between the ideal and the real—forever approaching but never fully realizing completeness.

- **√2, Square Root of 2** *1={2,2}*:
  Symbolizes geometric harmony and integrative balance. The ratio 1:√2 is uniquely significant, as it is the only proportion that perfectly maintains itself when folded in half, illustrating foundational and persistent structural balance.

- **φ ,Phi, Golden Ratio** *1={2,3}*:
  Embodies proportional harmony, self-similar structural elegance, and inherent self-ordering. φ is the numeric essence of balance, recursion, and sustainable growth.

  **e, Euler’s number** *1={1,1}*:
  Represents *Contribution* and *Integration*. It symbolizes the forward-moving, expansive force that continually integrates new elements, ideas, and energies, enriching and dynamically expanding the structure. Mathematically, *e^x^* and *ln(x)* are inverse functions, capturing the complementary nature of expansion and its required effort.

  **ln(2), Natural Logarithm of 2** *1={1,2}*:
  Represents *Definition* and *Limitation*. *ln(2)* reflects the necessary boundaries or constraints that define form, structure, or the meaning of growth. It provides the clarity and stability necessary to ensure coherent, sustainable expansion. The natural logarithm *ln(x)* is the inverse function of exponential growth (*e^x^*), emphasizing their complementary relationship.
