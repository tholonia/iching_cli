## Primordial Patterns and the Structure of Creation


We are going to zoom way out now to get an even broader, but more in-depth picture of the natural processes in play in the hopes it will add insight into the Tholonic model and the I Ching.

The Tholonic model is rooted in the ancient principle that from singularity arises duality. This is evident in the idea without *something*, the very notion of *nothing* would not exist, as *nothingness* is only meaningful in contrast to its opposite There is no argument as to which came first, as they can only exist simultaneously.

The concepts of 1 and 0 are the simplest and most practical concepts to represent this contrast of duality. In the context of mathematics, the sum of the parts of a whole equals the whole, so we can then say that 1 + 0 = 1, which tells us the whole equals 1. This sounds like 1<sup>st</sup> grade math… but let’s continue.

We can plot this a few different ways:


<center><img src='../Images/numbers-1_1.png' style='width:50%'/></center>

If this is a true statement, then it must be true for all numbers. Let’s try this with the first, and only the first, 8 (octal) numbers, 0-7, by making every pair of numbers that equals 7: 7+0, 6+1, 5+2, and 4+3, just like how the original pair of opposites, 1 and 0, equal the value of the parent, which *must* be 1.


<center><img src='../Images/numbers-1_2.png' style='width:80%'/></center>

Now we have a problem because, as is shown in the above one-level tree chart, we have four 7s, which when split make all the numbers 0-7, but what then are the two parents of these four 7s? If we apply the same logic, then those four 7s would have the two parents of 14 (**o**16) and 14 (**o**16), and we can’t have two parents of the same value. The problem is that any number we use as a parent number must be odd to create two children that are unique, but then we and up with two even valued grandparents, which isn’t allowed. In addition, if the top number is even, the number of possible pairs is an odd number. 

The challenge is that there is no existing number to represent parents. To solve this, we need to create new numbers—just as mathematics has done before with concepts like *imaginary numbers* and *pure imaginary numbers*, such as *i* (the square root of -1). Similarly, we will introduce our own set of imaginary numbers, which we will call *primordial numbers*.


<center><img src='../Images/number-chart.png' style='width:100%'/></center>



A primordial value can be defined as numeric concept that always instantiates as exactly two distinct numeric values whose sum equals the primordial number itself.

We need a number that can *simultaneously represent two (or more) distinct values that are inherently unequal*. This seemingly paradoxical requirement finds a close parallel in *quantum mechanics*. In quantum theory, a particle's state, such as *spin*, can exist in a *superposition*, holding multiple values at once until measured. Furthermore, *entanglement* demonstrates that two particles, regardless of distance, can be *correlated in a way that defies classical logic*. One particle’s measurement instantly determines the state of the other. This suggests that, at a fundamental level, reality does not always conform to a single, well-defined state but rather an *interdependent structure of potentialities*.

Similarly, our *primordial number* must function in a way that allows it to exist in multiple states at once, akin to a quantum superposition. For an accessible and insightful discussion of these ideas, see Quanta Magazine’s article *"Entanglement Made Simple"*.[^2]

[^2]: Quanta Magazine, *"Entanglement Made Simple,"* April 28, 2016. Available at https://www.quantamagazine.org/entanglement-made-simple-20160428/

In short: A primordial value can be defined as numeric concept that always instantiates as exactly two distinct numeric values whose sum equals the primordial number itself.

We can now apply this idea to our tree of 7, going all the way to the top, where we have the meta-value, or *first-order primordial number*, of A, which represents one unit from which these eight numbers emerge in the following manner.

<center><img src='../Images/numbers-1_3.png' style='width:80%'/></center>

We start with A and its first pair, which consists of A<sub>0</sub> and A<sub>1</sub>. On the next row, each one of those meta-values has its own pair, so A<sub>0</sub> has A<sub>01</sub> and A<sub>00</sub>, etc.

##### *Note: Don’t be confused if you are looking at the binary sub-indexes and seeing they do not match the decimal values. They are not suppose to be the same. This is explained in the next paragraphs.*

This can be demonstrated better in the following circular charts.

<center><img src='../Images/numbers-1_4.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

At the bottom of the above tree, we have eight states of A, each identified by the sub-index value representing its unique lineage from A. If you understand binary numbers, you’ll notice that the sub-indexes follow the perfect sequential order of 76543210 (starting from the left), yet the number they represent has a very different order: 70615243. This seems to make no logical sense, but in fact, it is an amazing relationship.

The sub-index values represent the path of expression from A, or position within the tree, that resulted in a number value. This is the *order of instantiation* (*OI*), while the value itself is the *value of instantiation* (*VI*). Look at how these two sets of values relate to one another. Below (top left) are the binary and decimal values for the *OI* sub-indexes and the value, *VI*, of that number.

<img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/numbers-1_5_2.png" style='width:100%'/>

In the top right form, the *value of instantiation* (*VI*) axis is perpendicular to the *order of instantiation* (*OI*) axis. These two axes are perfectly in sync with each other in two different axes and seem to be a natural process of reordering in a very efficient form of encoding (and therefore decoding) as the *value of instantiation* is an encoded version of the *order of instantiation*, and vice versa.  Notice also that the OI order automatically pairs values, which is an excellent example of solf-ordering.

We can see that no VI number can exist without having an implicit OI number, meaning each number must have two attributes: an attribute of how it is expressed (VI) and an attribute of how it came to exist (OI), and each of these must be unique.

The lower right form shows the four trigrams made of the parent and two children each. We still see the order, but it is in two sets. The lower left image shows how these values could be mapped to a tholon.

The relationship between *Order of Instantiation (OI)* and *Value of Instantiation (VI)* closely parallels the fundamental interplay between *electricity* and *magnetism* in physics. In electromagnetism, a changing electric field produces a magnetic field, and a changing magnetic field produces an electric field, two inseparable forces that always appear together and exist perpendicular to each other in space. Similarly, *OI* and *VI* exist in a perpendicular relationship, with *OI* representing the structured *path of emergence*, or the functions that brought it into being, and *VI* representing the representation or *form* of a number, how it instantiates, interacts, and expresses itself within the system, so, essentially, *form* and *function*.

This duality extends to other fundamental principles in physics: in quantum mechanics, position and momentum are complementary attributes that cannot be fully understood in isolation, and in relativity, space and time form a unified framework that defines all events. Likewise, in this model, every number must possess both an *OI* (function, structural definition) and a *VI* (form, functional expression), and together, they create a complete instantiation system. Each defines the other, forming an interdependent and self-sustaining system.

The significance of this duality suggests that the encoding of information in numbers follows a natural law of emergence, much like how electromagnetism encodes energy in waves. The perpendicular nature of OI and VI may reflect an efficient way for numerical systems to self-organize, much like how physical systems adopt the most stable and efficient configurations. This hints at a deeper *universal principle of structured emergence*, where the process by which something is instantiated is as fundamental as what it does once instantiated.

Technically speaking (and I need to say that because what comes next sounds quite esoteric, but it’s not meant to be), every instance, which is every *thing* that exists, is an expression the *One Thing* that all existence came from. In this example, that would be the primal A. In the Tholonic model, that would be the 0-dimensional dot. In both cases, we see a recombination of the very path that caused an instance to come into existence starting from the beginning of creation. If there is one source or many sources from which everything grew, then every instance, every thing, has a unique *OI* value which describes the path it has taken from its source. Because every OI is unique, so too is the VI.

There is one more perspective that is worth looking at. If we arrange this tree in its most natural evolving form (the synergetics of 60°), we get the following:

<center><img src='../Images/honeymap_2.png' style='width:90%'/></center>

—BEGIN

This OI/VI Chart reveals several fascinating structural and numerical relationships that suggest deeper underlying principles of emergence, encoding, and self-organization. These patterns not only provide insight into the tholonic I Ching but also reflect broader natural principles found in physics, information theory, and structured emergence, which we would expect.

We’ve already addressed the intrinsic law of structured emergence, where every number in this system has a unique OI-VI pairing, meaning that each number simultaneously holds two complementary attributes: its structural pathway (VI, *function*, *how* it emerged) and its functional role (OI, *form*, *what* it becomes). This duality falls squarely into the *Definition* (*how*) / *Contribution* (*what*) spectrum and can be applied to everything that exists.

A particularly unique pattern that emerges in this map is that 7 and 2 are the only values where OI and VI are identical. This means that for these two numbers, the process of *how* they emerged and *what* they ultimately became are fundamentally the same. Such a condition suggests that these numbers represent a kind of equilibrium within the system, where structure and function align perfectly. In self-organizing systems, equilibrium states are often critical points of stability, hinting that 7 and 2 play a special role in balancing or anchoring the system as a whole.

The role of 3/4, which si the only point of overlap between values, show the total OI=7 and the total VI=6.  This unique instance further emphasizes the unique nature of 7.  It also shows that 7 exists in two forms: once as a fusion of 3 and 4, and once as its own independent identity. Interestingly, the central vertical position of 3+4 as 7 is only shared by the primal "A," suggesting a unique connection between them, possibly linked to the fundamental process of creation. Additionally, 7~34~ (as 3+4) is the only OI value that emerges directly from the simplest duality of indexes A~10~ and A~01~, this shortest of all paths to A, reinforcing its role as a structurally significant number, as well as how 7 and 2 are points of equilibrium.  

We asked the AI to analyze the "OI values only" and "VI values only" maps, comparing their rows and columns to determine which exhibited greater order. The evaluation considered factors such as symmetry, pattern consistency, numeric and color consistency, and predictability. Interestingly, the AI found significantly more order in the OI values than in the VI values, suggesting the OI values reveal a higher degree of order when viewed non-linearly. It also found increased order in Map 3, where the primal "A" is positioned at the center of the hexagram rather than at the top or bottom, which aligns intuitively with expectations.

There may be multiple ways to plot this pattern of the emergent process, but the most obvious and appropriate in this case would be to map the 4 pairs of values onto two tetrahedrons, which works perfectly well with the OI pairs where every opposing pair of values equals 7, as shown below. Since two tetrahedrons form a cube, we can easily map the values to the cube.

This reveals an interesting pattern, with all the odd numbers on the top and all the even numbers on the bottom, both following a specific direction of increment. Following that pattern, we arrive at the classic symbol of infinity, which now has volume and a direction of movement.

<center><img src='../Images/OI_tholon_2.png' style='width:80%'/></center>

Now it appears that the OI pattern, which requires three dimensions, reveals a highly appropriate and specific representation of the movement of energy.

The infinity symbol (∞) was first used by the mathematician John Wallis (1655), inspired by the Roman symbol for 1,000 (CIƆ or M). However, the symbol’s origins trace back as far as 1600 BCE in the Egyptian Ouroboros, the symbol of a serpent eating its own tail, representing eternity and endless cycles.

I suspect that the ancients may have known of this tetrahedral-cube-based origin as well, but that knowledge was lost over time.

> > Our primordial numeric system, producing the OI and VI orders, naturally self-organizes into a double tetrahedron, a structure defining a complete Tholon composed of both a real and a virtual tetrahedron. Remarkably, these two tetrahedrons perfectly combine to form a cube, the foundational structure underpinning Cartesian reality. This complete Tholon, the cornerstone of the Tholonic model, elegantly illustrates the fundamental process of creation itself. Specifically, the OI pairs establish limitation and definition, determining the underlying numeric structure, while the VI pairs provide contribution and integration, manifesting as instantiated numeric values. These instantiated values, expressed as the octal and binary (base-2) number systems, form the practical numeric foundation utilized in mathematics and embodied in all modern digital technology. Thus, we observe a clear parallel: the defining, limiting principles (OI) represent the numeric creation process, while the integrative, contributing principles (VI) provide the actual numeric values that sustain our models of reality, such as mathematics and technology.

## DNA


We see these same patterns of progression, specifically the recursive splitting from core concepts into sub-concepts, the generation of opposites and their inversions, and the spatial reorientation into symmetric triads, in the most fundamental form of creation: genetics. Below is a graph that illustrates how the bases of adenine (*A*), cytosine (*C*), guanine (*G*), and thymine (*T*) pair together to form nucleotides. An *A* can only double bond with a *T*, and *C* can only triple bond with a *G*. This is accomplished by taking one side, inverting it (a negative image), then reversing it (horizontal flip). When we do that, the pairs automatically line up in their proper order. In the image below, we see the same concepts as above by considering the bases of *A, T, G, C* to be the instantiable form of some *meta-base*, or some instantiable archetype, such as the mate-base values that produce the numbers we saw above but are inexpressible. These are represented as the half-circles and full circles. We also assign sub-index values representing their paths, and, as you can see, every pair has two values that equal 3.

The intention is to show how at least one aspect of the mechanics of a DNA strand follows the same order, or pattern, of this archetype of *hierarchical primordial numbers* and that of many natural processes. For example, the parent of the bonded bases could be the concept of the class of compounds called purines or pyrimidines. Their parent, the source, could be the class of aromatic heterocyclic organic compounds, of which all the children are a member. Or perhaps it could be *Chargaff’s Rule*, which states, “DNA must have equal parts of GC and AT nucleotides.” There could be many different instances of these parents, but in every case, they will follow the same pattern of expression.


<center><img src='../Images/dna-clr.png' style='width:80%'/></center>

This inversion and reversal process is the same mechanism used in the I Ching, demonstrating how only 16 original hexagrams are needed to create 64 hexagrams, or rather, 32 inverted pairs of archetypes.

What is especially interesting is that the opposite (inverted and flipped) of the purine compound adenine is the pyrimidine compound thymine. This is significant because there cannot truly be an “opposite” of a compound, molecule, or atom in a strict chemical sense. However, there can be two compounds that function in an opposite manner within a specific context or task, where this “opposition” typically manifests as complementarity. In other contexts, these compounds behave very differently—such as how adenine is also used in cellular metabolism to transfer chemical energy between reactions.

From a Tholonic perspective, this demonstrates that the structure of a process is independent of the specific instances that apply it. This strongly suggests that the process archetype exists before it is instantiated.

This conclusion is a radical observation, as it implies that process and structure can exist independently of substance. In other words, DNA does not derive its form from the compounds that compose it—rather, the form exists as an archetype, and compounds that are compatible with that archetypal form naturally align with it.

We can validate this idea by identifying similar forms in DNA that also appear elsewhere. Many such examples exist in language and writing systems, neural networks and brain structures, crystals and quasicrystals, planetary and orbital resonance, economics and trade, software code, and computer algorithms, to name just a few.

There are correlations between the I Ching and DNA. For example, if we replace DNA concepts with I Ching concepts, we can say the following:


<center><img src='../Images/iching-dna.png' style='width:100%'/></center>



## Elements


In keeping with the traditional I Ching, we want to assign familiar real-world elements and properties. Using archetypes to describe a scene or function can be very helpful in tapping into our intuitive understanding. The traditional elements of the I Ching are: water, fire, wood, metal, and earth. These elements are traditionally said to work together in a sort of paper/rock/scissors manner:

> - Wood generates Fire, Fire generates Earth, Earth generates Metal, Metal generates Water and Water generates Wood.
>
> - Wood weakens Water, Water weakens Metal, Metal weakens Earth, Earth weakens Fire and Fire weakens Wood.
>
> - Wood controls Earth, Earth controls Water, Water controls Fire, Fire controls Metal and Metal controls Wood.
>
> - Wood insults Metal, Metal insults Fire, Fire insults Water, Water insults Earth and Earth insults Wood.

However, we are using Western *primordial* elements here as they are a better fit and are more flexible in general. For the cardinal points, we have the four classics of *Air*, *Water*, *Earth*, and *Fire*. We italicize these archetypes to distinguish them from the physical elements. These archetypes represent qualities and properties of the elements that can be found in anything, and not simply the physical instances of air, water, earth, and fire.

We have also adopted the astrological/Neo-Platonic qualities of these elements. Of course, any other definitions could be used to create interpretations that are consistent with other perspectives.


<center><img src='../Images/elements.png' style='width:80%'/></center>

### Here are the explanations of the cardinal and transitional elements with their reasoning and correlation with the triads.

### <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/e_earth.png" style='width:30px'/>***EARTH*** <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/trigram-b00.png" style='width:60px'/> 0

*Earth* represents the foundation upon which everything is built as well as the resources from which they are built. It is cardinal, winter solstice, inward, the non-moving point between deflation and inflation. Instances of this are **resources**, **foundations**, **support**.

The trigram shows the symbol of a perfect Yin state.

The quadrant of *Earth* <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/trigram-b00.png" style='width:30px'/> exists between the dynamic properties of *Emptying* <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/trigram-b04.png" style='width:30px'/> and *Filling* <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/trigram-b01.png" style='width:30px'/> and therefore represents the extreme Yin pole, where the maximum point of *Emptying* is reached and where *Filling* begins. In this way, it is also a tipping point

1.  **Negotiation** <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/yin.png" style='width:30px'/>
    In the context of *Earth*, a Yin *Negotiation* represents a passive yet fertile foundation, ready to receive and shape whatever is introduced. Like soil awaiting a seed, it does not impose restrictions on what it can accept, but the nature of what grows depends on the surrounding conditions. Just as a swamp lily will struggle in a desert, the environment itself negotiates what can take root and thrive.
2.  **Definition** <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/yin.png" style='width:30px'/>
    A Yin *Definition* in the context of *Earth* signifies a state shaped entirely by external influences. It does not impose its own structure but provides the foundation upon which all else is built. Like clay in the hands of a potter or water conforming to its container, *Earth* as Yin *Definition* is formed by the forces that act upon it. It remains receptive while offering stability to whatever takes shape upon it.
3.  **Contribution** <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/yin.png" style='width:30px'/>
    In the context of *Earth*, a Yin *Contribution* provides the space and conditions necessary for Yang to emerge. It does not act directly but enables creation by its presence alone. Just as zero defines the space in which one can exist or emptiness allows form to arise, *Earth’s* contribution is its stability and receptivity, forming the foundation upon which all else is built.

### <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/e_water.png" style='width:30px'/>***WATER*** <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/trigram-b02.png" style='width:60px'/> 2

*Water* represents the movement from darkness to light, Yin to Yang, lifelessness to life. It is cardinal, associated with the spring equinox, the season of ascending energy and renewal. Water embodies the perfect balance of lessening Yin and increasing Yang, symbolizing flow, adaptability, and transformation. Instances of this include **electricity**, **nourishment**, **cleansing**, and **rivers**.

The quadrant of *Water* <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/trigram-b02.png" style='width:30px'/> exists between the dynamic properties of *Filling* <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/trigram-b01.png" style='width:30px'/> and *Collecting* <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/trigram-b03.png" style='width:30px'/>. It represents the balance between Yin and Yang, achieved when Yang penetrates Yin at its center. Oceans and lakes fill and become still, but water collects and returns to the river, initiating movement that naturally flows back to its source. Water is the most inward-moving of all states, always seeking depth and unity.

The trigram shows the symbol of Yang energy penetrating Yin at its core, illustrating that water, though yielding, is defined by movement and flow.

1. **Negotiation** <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/yin.png" style='width:30px'/>
   In the context of *Water*, a Yin *Negotiation* represents absolute adaptability. *Water* does not resist, it cedes to whatever holds it, taking the shape of its container. However, this is not passivity but a dynamic flexibility, allowing it to move through, around, and even erode what confines it.

- **Definition** <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/yang.png" style='width:30px'/>
  A Yang definition in the context of *Water* signifies that movement is its defining characteristic. *Water* exists only in motion, whether as a river carving valleys, currents shaping the ocean, or electricity flowing through a circuit. Unlike *Earth*, which defines through structure, *Water* defines through its ability to move, change, and sustain.

- **Contribution** <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/yin.png" style='width:30px'/>
  In the context of *Water*, a Yin *Contribution* is its ability to give without depletion. *Water* follows the path of least resistance, nourishing all life and ecosystems before returning to its source, essentially unchanged yet transformative. It takes nothing, yet gives everything, embodying the nature of growth, renewal, and expansion.

### <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/e_wind.png" style='width:30px'/>Air <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/trigram-b07.png" style='width:60px'/> 7

*Air* represents the arena of growth and creation. What emerges from the Yin of *Earth* expands into the Yang of *Air*. It is the force that holds all things in place, yet it is also symbolic of spirit, revealing a life that extends beyond earthly limitations. It is cardinal, associated with the summer solstice, and represents outward expansion. Air is the non-moving point between inflation and deflation, the moment of fullness before release. Instances of this include **birth**, **exploration**, and **imagination**.

The quadrant of *Air* <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/trigram-b07.png" style='width:30px'/> exists between the dynamic properties of *Collecting* <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/trigram-b03.png" style='width:30px'/> and *Releasing* <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/trigram-b06.png" style='width:30px'/>. It represents the turning point where the internal journey transitions into the external journey. This is the extreme Yang pole, the moment when the process of Collecting reaches its maximum, and Releasing must soon begin.

1. **Negotiation** <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/yang.png" style='width:30px'/>
   In the context of *Air*, a Yang *Negotiation* seeks movement, expansion, and creation. *Air* does not settle; it actively explores, reaching outward to interact with the Yin. Just as the wind finds every gap and fills every space, *Air* is in constant search of new frontiers, never bound by limitations.

- **Definition** <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/yang.png" style='width:30px'/>
  A Yang definition in the context of *Air* arises through discovery. The unknown is Yin in nature, but the act of exploring it is Yang. It is only by venturing into the unknown that boundaries are defined and limitations are revealed. Like the first breath of life or the expansion of thought, Air moves forward without hesitation, shaping its world by uncovering its edges.

- **Contribution** <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/yang.png" style='width:30px'/>
  In the context of *Air*, a Yang *Contribution* is the force that opens new doors and reveals new horizons. *Air* does not preserve the past; it propels existence forward, clearing away the stagnant and bringing fresh energy. Just as the wind carries seeds to distant lands or ideas spread through inspiration, *Air’s* contribution is the endless renewal of possibilities.

### <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/e_fire.png" style='width:30px'/>***FIRE*** <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/trigram-b05.png" style='width:60px'/> 5

*Fire* represents the force that allows manifestation, transforming idea into form. It is cardinal, associated with the fall equinox, and represents descent and release. It embodies the perfect balance of lessening Yang and increasing Yin, symbolizing transformation, consumption, and illumination. Instances of this include **light** and **consumption**.

The trigram shows the symbol of Yang on the outside but is dependent on a Yin center, much like a fire that shines light while consuming its fuel. As the Yang dissipates, the form it sustained is reduced to ashes, revealing the cyclical nature of creation and destruction.

The quadrant of *Fire* <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/trigram-b05.png" style='width:30px'/> exists between the dynamic properties of *Releasing* <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/trigram-b06.png" style='width:30px'/> and *Emptying* <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/trigram-b04.png" style='width:30px'/>. It represents the dissipation of energy, the process through which form emerges and light is revealed. This is the zenith of outward expression, where energy reaches its peak before surrendering to entropy.

- **Negotiation** <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/yang.png" style='width:30px'/>
  In the context of *Fire*, a Yang *Negotiation* is the buildup of energy that seeks release. *Fire* does not hesitate; it ignites, consumes, and transforms. Just as a flame must burn to fulfill its purpose, *Fire* is always in the process of exchanging energy, preparing to radiate outward.

- **Definition** <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/yin.png" style='width:30px'/>
  A Yin definition in the context of *Fire* signifies the return of Yin as Yang is released. *Fire* is defined not by what it holds, but by what it gives away. As energy dissipates, form takes shape, but only for a moment before it, too, is consumed. Like the glow of embers or the fading warmth of a sunset, *Fire’s* nature is entropy: the dissolution of structure into energy.

- **Contribution** <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/yang.png" style='width:30px'/>
  In the context of *Fire*, a Yang *Contribution* is the act of sharing energy with the world. *Fire* does not keep its power contained; it radiates light, heat, and movement, illuminating everything it touches. Whether as the warmth of the sun, the blaze of a hearth, or the spark of inspiration, *Fire’s* gift is transformation, giving all of itself so that something new may arise.



## Transitional or Dynamic Interactions


### ***Release*** <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/trigram-b06.png" style='width:60px'/> 6  (AIR <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/trigram-b07.png" style='width:30px'/><img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/e_wind.png" style='width:30px'/> & FIRE <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/trigram-b05.png" style='width:30px'/><img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/e_fire.png" style='width:30px'/>)

*Release* represents accumulated energy that seeks balance. In the process of balancing itself, it dissipates both itself and its recipient, leading to transformation. It is the initial outward movement that leads to expression. Instances of this include **lightning**, the **Big Bang**, and **inspiration**.

The trigram shows the symbol of Yin energy re-entering solid Yang. A new Yin line appears in the lowest position, representing beginning, birth, and idea. The middle line remains Yang, showing that Yang is still dominant in this phase. Because of this, the transition remains Yang in nature, signifying a dynamic release of energy.

The quadrant of *Air* <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/trigram-b07.png" style='width:30px'/> and *Fire* <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/trigram-b05.png" style='width:30px'/> is one of outward-descending movement, or external Yang. Here, Yang has reached the limits of sustainability and must move in the opposite direction. When extreme Yang mixes with Yin, there is a powerful release of energy, resulting in *Fire*. This quadrant is outward because creation is a process where energy (yang) takes form (yin), and form exists in the outer world. It is descending because Yang expands, and in doing so, it also dissipates itself.

    When Yang energy reaches completion, it has nowhere left to go—it must interact with Yin. At this point, Yang becomes dependent on Yin for its continued existence, marking a shift where Yang is subservient to Yin. Just as a storm builds until it has no choice but to discharge lightning, the balance between forces now dictates the outcome.
2.  **Definition** <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/yang.png" style='width:30px'/>
    When Yang meets Yin, it seeks immediate release, pushing against the boundaries imposed by Yin. This pressure defines the moment of transition, where energy moves into form but does so explosively. The moment before a star ignites or an idea is expressed is the tension of Yang pushing against its limits, eager to break free.
3.  **Contribution** <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/yang.png" style='width:30px'/>
    The expression of Yang manifests as *Fire*, consuming the Yin as it releases its energy. This is the moment of illumination, ignition, and transformation—where what was once stored potential becomes a force of action. Whether in the form of a burning flame, a flash of inspiration, or the explosive power of creation, *Fire* is the visible result of release.

### ***Emptying*** <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/trigram-b04.png" style='width:60px'/> 4 (FIRE <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/trigram-b05.png" style='width:30px'/><img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/e_fire.png" style='width:30px'/> & EARTH <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/trigram-b00.png" style='width:30px'/><img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/e_earth.png" style='width:30px'/>)

*Emptying* represents the dissipation and movement of energy through matter. It is the process that brings order out of chaos, the final outward deflation that returns energy to its primordial state, completing the cycle of creation. Instances of this include **music**, the creation of the **elements**, and **death**.

The quadrant of *Fire* <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/trigram-b05.png" style='width:30px'/> and *Earth* <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/trigram-b00.png" style='width:30px'/> represents final descension, or external Yin, where the energy of *Fire* dissipates and transforms into *Earth*. This quadrant is external because *Fire* transitions into *Earth*, moving from pure energy into structure. It is descending because the energy of creation wanes and stabilizes, shifting from the active state of *Fire* to the structured state of *Earth*. This is the process that converts energy into mass (*m=E/c^2^*), where the dissolution of *Fire* gives rise to the solid reality of *Earth*.

##### Historical footnote: m=E/c^2^, not E=mc^2^, was the original formula that Einstein introduced.  It later became  E=mc^2^ for convenience sake.

   In the dynamic between *Fire* and *Earth*, *Fire* is always dependent on *Earth* for expression. Energy alone has no form, it requires a medium through which it can be observed and experienced. Just as flames must consume fuel, *Fire* can only act within the structure provided by *Earth*.

- **Definition** <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/yin.png" style='width:30px'/>
  *Fire* finds its limits and boundaries in *Earth*, just as energy is only measurable through matter. Without *Earth*, *Fire* would burn without definition, unable to take shape. The constraints of *Earth* determine the expression of *Fire*, just as the properties of physical matter determine how energy manifests in the world.

- **Contribution** <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/yang.png" style='width:30px'/>
  The restructuring of matter by energy is what brings everything into existence. *Fire* reshapes and transforms *Earth*, creating new patterns, forms, and structures. Whether in the fusion of elements in a star, the creative process of music, or the transformation of life into death and renewal, emptying is the action that finalizes creation by dissolving energy into structure.

### ***Filling*** <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/trigram-b01.png" style='width:60px'/> 1 (EARTH <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/trigram-b00.png" style='width:30px'/><img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/e_earth.png" style='width:30px'/>& WATER <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/trigram-b01.png" style='width:30px'/><img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/e_water.png" style='width:30px'/>)

*Filling* represents form coming to life. It is the initial inward inflation of a new cycle, the moment when energy begins to enter and shape an empty vessel. Instances of this include **gestation**, **dark matter** (expansion of the universe), and **artificial intelligence**.

The trigram shows the return of Yang energy in the lowest position, signifying the first movement toward manifestation. However, the center remains Yin, meaning the process is still within the domain of receptivity rather than full expression.

The quadrant of *Earth* <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/trigram-b00.png" style='width:30px'/> and *Water* <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/trigram-b01.png" style='width:30px'/> represents new beginnings, or internal Yin, where the emptiness of *Earth* begins to receive energy and return to life. It is inward because Yang enters from the lowest position and ascending because Yang continues to rise, gradually shaping what was once formless.

1.  **Negotiation** <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/yang.png" style='width:30px'/>
    In the context of *Filling*, a Yang *Negotiation* arises because the absence of Yang naturally draws it inward. Just as a vacuum pulls in air, or an empty vessel invites substance, the void within *Earth* seeks to be filled. The process begins not through force, but through attraction, as Yang enters to restore balance.
2.  **Definition** <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/yin.png" style='width:30px'/>
    A Yin *Definition* in the context of *Filling* signifies that Yang must first shape the empty Yin vessel before it can express itself. Before light can shine, it must have a source; before a seed can grow, it must find soil. Yang is present, but its form is determined by the structure and capacity of *Earth* to hold and shape it.
3.  **Contribution** <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/yin.png" style='width:30px'/>
    In the context of *Filling*, a Yin *Contribution* represents the universal availability of Yang energy, which can be accessed from anywhere. Just as *Earth* serves as an electrical ground for all circuits, the presence of a stable, receptive state allows energy to be drawn upon when needed. *Filling* does not create energy—it opens the space for energy to flow, forming the foundation for all future manifestations.

### ***Collecting*** <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/trigram-b03.png" style='width:60px'/> 3 (WATER <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/trigram-b01.png" style='width:30px'/><img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/e_water.png" style='width:30px'/> & AIR <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/trigram-b07.png" style='width:30px'/><img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/e_wind.png" style='width:30px'/>)

*Collecting* represents the higher orders of structure that extend ever outward. It is the final internal inflation, the stage of completion and preparation before outward expression. Instances of this include the **Internet**, **space-born viruses**, and the **Mongol Empire**, each representing a system that has expanded and gathered momentum before dispersing its influence.

This trigram, with two emerging Yang lines, signifies a shift into the domain of Yang. The structure is still forming, but the final transition toward full Yang dominance is approaching.

The quadrant of *Water* <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/trigram-b01.png" style='width:30px'/> and *Air* <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/trigram-b07.png" style='width:30px'/> represents preparation, or internal Yang, where the balanced state of Water ascends and expands into the polar state of *Air*. This is the moment when gathered energy reaches its peak before transitioning into outward expansion.

1. **Negotiation** <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/yang.png" style='width:30px'/>
   In the context of *Collecting*, a Yang *Negotiation* marks the shift toward dominance, as Yang begins to outnumber and overtake the remaining Yin. This is the turning point where structure is no longer being shaped by constraints but begins to establish its own rules. Like a movement gaining critical mass, this is the moment when preparation nears completion and momentum becomes self-sustaining.

- **Definition** <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/yang.png" style='width:30px'/>
  A Yang definition in the context of *Collecting* signifies the culmination of expression. No longer bound by the limitations of *Earth*, Yang is free to expand into the boundless domain of *Air*. This is the ultimate phase of growth, where an instance reaches its fullest potential, whether as an empire at its height, a network reaching global scale, or an idea expanding beyond its creator.

- **Contribution** <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/yin.png" style='width:30px'/>
  In the context of *Collecting*, a Yin *Contribution* represents what remains after the peak of expansion has passed. The influence of a system, idea, or creation persists beyond its initial expression, leaving a legacy only time can reveal. Like the ripples left by a great movement or the data of the past embedded in the present, Collecting ensures that something endures beyond the moment of expansion itself.
