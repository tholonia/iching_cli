## A Comprehensive Integration

This book serves as the foreword and introduction to The Tholonic I Ching, but it is published separately because it is far more than a standard introduction. Instead of a brief preface, this book attempts to provide a comprehensive overview of two complex models, requiring special explanations; hence its many pages. I say “attempt” because, in truth, this book is a more of collection of the notes and research developed in my attempts to prove, or disprove, the fundamental premises of the Tholonic Model, but presented in a more coherent, presentable manner.

Including this material within The Tholonic I Ching would make the book overly cumbersome, adding significant bulk to its already 550 pages. More importantly, this extended introduction would disrupt the book’s aesthetic balance and detract from the reading experience. Additionally, most readers of The Tholonic I Ching may not require or be interested in such an in-depth explanation, making its inclusion unnecessary.

Another reason for publishing this book separately is that both books evolve independently. While The Tholonic I Ching and this introduction are updated regularly, they do not follow the same revision schedule. Keeping them separate ensures that each book can develop at its own pace, allowing for ongoing refinement without disrupting the other. 

## The Tholonic Explanation of how the I Ching Functions

The question at hand is this: how can the act of throwing the I Ching, selecting a hexagram through a process that appears to be random, provide meaningful insight into your personal reality, or even hint at what lies ahead? More precisely, how can a symbolic outcome derived from tossing coins or sorting yarrow stalks resonate so deeply with the complex and evolving configuration of forces that make up your life?

The answer begins with the understanding that, according to the Tholonic model, all forms, across all scopes and scales of existence, emerge from the interplay of three universal principles: negotiation, definition, and contribution. These are not abstract labels but active processes. Wherever anything comes into form, these three forces are at work. They generate patterns not only in stars, atoms, and ecosystems, but also in emotions, relationships, questions, and moments of choice. Reality is not made of things; it is made of interacting processes that temporarily coalesce into forms. Each form is an instance, an emergence, a crystallization, of those universal dynamics.

When you cast the I Ching, you are not merely drawing a symbol. You are initiating a microcosmic act of creation. Your question, your posture, your emotional state, your timing, and the method of casting are all expressions of the same triadic forces. The very act of asking the I Ching for insight creates a local field of interaction—it narrows the boundless potential of awareness into a defined space of intention. Within that space, a new instance emerges: the resulting hexagram. This is not an arbitrary pattern imposed from the outside, but a reflection of the very moment you are inhabiting—because the processes that produced it are the same ones currently shaping your reality.

This is why the hexagram that appears feels meaningful. It is not that the I Ching “knows” your future. Rather, it expresses a structural snapshot of the recursive, formative processes shaping your moment as it unfolds.. It is a symbolic emergence that mirrors the conditions you are actively participating in. The casting of coins is chaotic in appearance but sensitive to conditions. It is a snapshot of the patterning forces in motion, captured through a symbolic medium.

The 64 hexagrams themselves are not predictive in a deterministic sense, but they are archetypal configurations that describe common patterns of transformation. When you receive a hexagram, it is as though the I Ching is revealing the archetypal structure behind the current moment of your reality. And since every moment contains within it the tension of what is becoming, that structure can also hint at the directions in which your current configuration is likely to evolve.

Thus, the I Ching does not predict the future in the conventional sense. Rather, it reveals the formative pattern from which the next moment—another instance—is likely to emerge. Because you are part of the system that generated the result, the reading contains relevance. The same process that produced the hexagram is at work in the creation of galaxies, thoughts, decisions, and outcomes. This is what binds the result to reality, not metaphorically, but structurally.

In this way, the act of throwing the I Ching is not trivial; it is a momentary reenactment of the universal act of creation. You are engaging, symbolically and actually, with the generative forces of existence. The hexagram that emerges is not foreign to your world; it is of your world, composed of the same recursive energies that shape all things. That is why it can speak meaningfully to you, and why it deserves to be listened to.

This perspective aligns with the understanding that the I Ching is not merely a tool for divination but a means of engaging with the ongoing creation of reality itself. Each casting is an opportunity to observe and understand the emergent patterns that are shaping your experience, providing guidance that is deeply rooted in the very processes that construct the universe.

Thus, the I Ching serves as a bridge between the individual and the cosmos, offering a way to perceive and align with the fundamental forces that continuously bring new forms into being. Through this engagement, you are not only seeking answers but are participating in the perpetual unfolding of reality.

To throw the I Ching, then, is to listen; to the world, to the moment, and to the pattern that is becoming you.

This understanding also helps explain a curious and often-reported phenomenon: that the very act of throwing the I Ching regarding a problem frequently seems to initiate its resolution. Within the Tholonic model, this makes perfect sense. When a question is posed with sincere intention, it is not merely an intellectual exercise; it is an act of focusing awareness, of defining and negotiating the boundaries of an emergent instance. That act alone begins to clarify the internal structure of the issue at hand. The problem begins to resolve not because of some mystical intervention, but because the questioner is participating more consciously in the recursive forces already shaping the situation.

The casting itself functions as a moment of pattern recognition. By anchoring awareness to a symbolic structure, the I Ching allows a disorganized or chaotic emotional field to collapse into clarity. Often, our difficulties persist not because they are truly unsolvable, but because their internal architecture remains undefined. In consulting the I Ching, we narrow our attention to the essential forces at play. The hexagram offers not a solution in the form of instructions, but a mirror that reveals the dynamic pattern beneath the surface of experience. In this way, the symbolic act of consultation becomes a structural intervention. The moment we see the pattern, the instance begins to shift.

Moreover, because the I Ching operates on the principle of alignment with the deeper rhythms of emergence, the act of engaging with it often draws the questioner into greater harmony with those rhythms. What previously felt stuck or opaque begins to move. Decisions that once seemed difficult resolve themselves through clarity of orientation. Emotions settle. Action becomes more natural. It is not that the I Ching "fixes" the problem, but that it restores the flow between the inner and outer patterns of awareness.

In short, the I Ching does not only reveal the structure of the present, it also subtly reorganizes it by making it visible. And once visible, the recursive forces that shape reality are no longer acting in the dark. They are seen, named, and understood, and therefore, transformed.

# I: Foundations of the Tholonic I Ching

## Bridging Ancient Wisdom and Universal Patterns


This exploration aims to examine the ancient wisdom of the I Ching through the lens of the Tholonic model, demonstrating not only how this 5,000-year-old system of divination and philosophy aligns with modern understandings of energy, consciousness, and creation, but how it can expand upon and explain the Tholonic model, and vice versa as well. By examining the I Ching’s fundamental concepts of yin and yang, trigrams, and hexagrams within the framework of tholonic principles, we can bridge ancient Eastern wisdom with contemporary Western thought, revealing the universal patterns that underlie all systems of knowledge and existence, which are foundational to the Tholonic model.



## Why Choose the I Ching?


The Tholonic model is compatible with virtually all conceptual models of reality and creation, so why did we single out the choice of the I Ching?

 *Accessibility:* The *I Ching* is one of the oldest, accessible, and practical models of the creative process available.

*Quantifiable Properties:* Its structured system of hexagrams and lines provides quantifiable properties that make it easy to compare with the Tholonic Model.

*Historical Significance:* With thousands of years of use and study, the *I Ching* offers a deep well of knowledge for comparative analysis.

*Extensive Commentary:* Its rich body of commentary and interpretations adds depth and context, making it an excellent reference point.

*Cross-Disciplinary and cross-cultural acceptance:* The I Ching is recognized worldwide, influencing philosophy, religion, art, literature, science, technology, and medicine across Western, Jewish, Islamic, Asian, and East Asian cultures. Its principles are studied at leading universities such as Oxford, Cambridge, Columbia, and Stanford.

Additionally, the I Ching shares and predates core principles with several major belief systems, such as Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism, Kabbalah, Hermeticism, Indigenous Wisdom Traditions, Sufism, Judaism, Islam, and Christianity, particularly their emphasis on *balance* and the interplay of opposites, *cyclical transformation* and growth, and the *interconnectedness* of all things.

The Tholonic model and the I Ching also share the axiomatic and quite common principle that everything emerges from and exists within a duality, with the identical intention. While the Tholonic model describes an all-encompassing three-dimensional holarchy of all that can exist in the form of a fractal tetrahedral matrix, the 5,000-year-old legendary and mythical ruler *Fu Xi* (~2700 BCE)) Created the I Ching to *“become thoroughly conversant with the numinous and bright and to classify the myriad things.”*



## Essential Tholonic Terminology

### Yin Yang: The Fundamental Duality


Most people have some concept of what *yin* and *yang* represent, but for clarification, we’ll reiterate: sometimes the words “positive” and “negative,” or the symbols “+” and “-,” are used to represent yang and yin, but this concept is woefully insufficient to represent their true multidimensional complexity. Here are some traditional examples of yin and yang qualities that will help you get a feel for what they mean if you are not already familiar with them: **Yin**: dark, night, winter, moon, female, cold, water, alkaline, patience, to be, to rest, single-tasking, de-flamed, soothed, holistic, university of life, letting go, death, disease, emotion, not being, uncertainty, chaos, illogical, heart-based feelings. **Yang**: light, day, summer, sun, male, hot, fire, acid, impetuosity, action, multi-tasking, inflammation, burnout, allopathy, academia, control, life, health, to be, certainty, order, logic.

More importantly, the concepts of yin and yang are relative. For example, “to be” exists in both categories, as “being” can be yin and/or yang, just as water is yang to earth and yin to fire. Like everything, the perception of properties is relative to the context and scope of its existence and application.



### Holon and Parton: Components of Existence


<img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/0_001.png" style='float:right;width:30%'/>A holon is sustainable and stable system, process, or concept that has a clear definition, and a parton are the contributing components that allow for that holon to exist and helps define the form am function of the holon.

A cell is a holon, but as a liver cell, is is a parton to the holon of the liver, just as the cell’s nucleus, mitochondria, and membrane are partons to the holon of the cell

Holons and partons combine to form self-organizing networks of interactions and relationships called a *holarchy*.[^15]

[^15]: **Koestler, Arthur.** *The Ghost in the Machine.* Hutchinson, 1967.



### NDC: Negotiation, Definition, and Contribution


*NDC* stands for *Negotiation-Definition-Contribution*, also known as *balance-limitation-integration*. In the Tholonic model, this trinity of interactions form the foundation of all existence:

**Negotiation (Balance):** This represents the process of balancing or achieving equilibrium between interacting forces. Depending on context, it can act as a verb (the *act* of balancing or negotiating) or as a noun (the *state* of having achieved balance or becoming negotiated). In diagrams presented in this book, this  *Negotiation* concept is represented as a *blue* dot, and acts acts as an initiating point, also called an *N*-state.

**Definition (Limitation):** This refers to the restrictions or boundaries that shape any creation, whether material (available physical resources), energetic (available energy), or structural (contextual constraints like sustainability, time, or space). In our diagrams, this is represented as a *green* dot.

**Contribution (Integration/Interaction):** This represents what a process returns to the environment it was created.  Contributions can take many forms, such as interactions, material resources, ideas, or any effect that influences the system it exists in and interacts with. In our diagrams, this is represented as a *red* dot.

<img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/0_006.png" style='float:right;width:100%'/>

Within the Tholonic model, the *NDC* trinity describes the core dynamic that allows systems to emerge, sustain themselves, and interact with their surroundings. In our diagrams, the emergent property that results from the interaction of *NDC* is typically represented as a *yellow* dot in two-dimensional maps, or a *white* dot in three-dimensional maps, depending on the context and can also act as an *n-child* or *n-state*.

The image below illustrates a simple example comparing a 3D map and a 2D map representing the same concept. The Gaussian curve at the base of the 2D map shows how Limitation (D) and Integration (C) interact to form a spectrum of possible outcomes. New child instances are most likely to emerge near the center of this spectrum, where there is an optimal balance between Limitation and Integration.

<img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/4forces-tetra_v3.png" style='width:80%'/>

Here we see a potential problem;  How can the yellow dot on the 2D map be considered equivalent to the white dot on the 3D tetrahedron when they appear in different positions, with the yellow dot on the <u>*CD*</u> spectrum and the white dot as a separate fourth point?

The yellow dot on the 2D map and the white dot on the 3D tetrahedron represent the same emergent point, but the difference in placement is due to dimensional compression. The yellow dot's position on the 2D map signifies the optimal equilibrium point where emergence is most likely, maintaining conceptual compatibility despite dimensional reduction.

The relationships on the 2D map are simpler and more linear compared to those on the 3D map. The 2D map primarily represents a balance between two opposing forces or concepts (contribution and limitation), with the yellow dot positioned as a midpoint along the spectrum. This straightforward relationship makes the 2D map a useful shorthand for visualizing balance and emergence. In contrast, the 3D tetrahedron involves more complex interactions because it integrates three interconnected vertices (negotiation, contribution, and limitation) converging at a fourth point, representing a balanced culmination. The 3D representation captures the nuanced interplay between all three forces simultaneously, while the 2D map distills this complexity into a simplified projection that focuses on the most prominent balance.



### N-child or n-state: Emergence and Recursion


An *N-child* or *n-state* (with a lowercase “n”) refers to a new sustainable point that emerges from the children of an *N*-state (with an uppercase “*N*”) as a result of the system’s *NDC* interactions. This new creation inherits the structure and properties of its parent *N*-state but develops its unique identity. The term *N*-state typically refers to the parent (blue) point, and *n-state* or *n-child* refers to the child point (yellow or white) depending on what aspects of the child is being referred to.

Due to the recursive nature of the *thologram*, these *n-states* can evolve into *N-states* when they mature into stable systems capable of generating their own *n-states*, continuing the cycle of creation.



### Tholon: The Tetrahedral Building Block


A *tholon* is a specific type of holon within the Tholonic model that is represented as a tetrahedral unit composed of a central concept, representing a *Negotiated* state, or *N*-state (blue dot), and two partons, representing *Defining* properties (red dot) and a *Contributing* properties (green dot), interacting to produce an emergent outcome (white/yellow dot). These four points, when presented in 3D, form the tetrahedral structure of a *tholon*. Think of the *tholon* as a building block of reality, similar to how an atom represent the sustainable state of atomic equilibrium defined by its quantum and structural limitations which determines its ability to interact and form new stable structures, or any structure with its specific form and function.

There is also the concept of a *virtual* *tholon*. This occurs when the multi-generational self-similar 2D triangular grid collapses into a 3D tetrahedral matrix, or *thologram*.  In such a matrix, all tetrahedrons on the odd-numbered generations are orthoscopic, or front-facing, while even-numbered generations collapse to the pseudoscopic, or rear-facing. We refer to the front-facing tholons as *real* *tholons* and the back-facing *tholons* as *virtual* *tholons* or *reflection* *tholons*. This means that the child *tholon* is always the opposite of the parent.  *Real tholons* can exist with *virtual tholons*, and vise versa.



### Thologram: The Recursive Structure of Creation


These tetrahedral matrices form the *thologram* is a self-organizing, self-similar, recursive tetrahedral matrix that represents the structure that serves as a universal framework that applies to all forms of creation, whether abstract, such as theories, beliefs, and ideas, or material, such as galaxies, organisms, and ecosystems. Through its recursive nature, the thologram illustrates how patterns of creation repeat and evolve across different scales and contexts, reflecting the interconnected and self-organizing nature of existence.

## Awareness & Intention: Source of Energy and Existence

### Thought Experiment: The Zero-Dimensional Point


To best understand the basic premise of the Tholonic model, let’s use a thought experiment.

Imagine a zero-dimensional point within an infinite void of nothingness. It exists only as a concept, without form, dimensions, or measurable properties. Its existence depends entirely on your awareness of it.

Hold this concept of a 0D point in your mind.

A core principle of the Tholonic model is that everything created inherits the attributes and limitations of its creator, albeit subject to the influence of the environment. We find this same concept in many arenas, such as philosophy, metaphysics, and science. It suggests that every creation carries an imprint of its origin, shaped by the nature, constraints, and intention of its source. It’s the basic concept behind why plants create plants, not cats or sneakers. In this case, where we have a conceptual point in a void of nothingness, there is no environment, and our 0D point, being only a concept, doesn’t even exist outside of a concept in your mind. However, given that our 0D point is an instance of *awareness*, i.e., a concept, we can say that this point, being a creation of awareness, has the property of *awareness*. Not only that, it must also have the property of *intention*, given that the awareness that conceived it did so with the intent to conceive it. In the Tholonic model, awareness and intention always exist together, as one cannot exist without the other.

Of course, it’s difficult to imagine our conceptual point as having its own awareness or intentions. However, if you possessed infinite awareness and focused all of your intention onto a zero-dimensional point, you would create a singularity of awareness, representing infinite potential concentrated into absolute and minimal definition.

According to the Tholonic model, this would result in:

- **Negotiation (Balance):** Infinite awareness condensed into a perfectly balanced state—an equilibrium between everything and nothing, potential and actuality, chaos and order.

- **Definition (Limitation):** By narrowing infinite awareness down to a single, dimensionless concept, you impose the greatest possible limitation, reducing infinite possibilities to absolute singularity. Paradoxically, this limitation creates a gateway back into infinite potential.

- **Contribution (Integration):** This singular point becomes the ultimate seed for manifestation. It inherently demands emergence because infinite potential naturally seeks expression. The precise act of defining this point sets the stage for creative expansion, inevitably leading to the generation of new realities, dimensions, or universes from this intense concentration of awareness.

It may initially seem strange or counterintuitive to suggest that a concept possesses its own limited form of awareness and intention. Typically, we view concepts as passive constructs created by human awareness. However, from the Tholonic perspective, awareness and intention are not separate phenomena. Instead, they are two perspectives or expressions of a single, underlying principle, much like electricity and magnetism or form and function; one reality perceived from two complementary angles, depending on the context.

This unified principle represents a fundamental and omnipresent force from which our entire reality evolves, echoing panpsychic views in which consciousness permeates all existence, with individual instances of awareness emerging from this universal field. Even a simple concept can therefore embody this principle in a limited form. A concept maintains its boundaries (definition) and interacts meaningfully with other concepts (contribution), demonstrating what can be perceived as intention. At the same time, it continuously responds and adapts to interactions, thereby exhibiting a primitive form of awareness.

Thus, rather than being consciously deliberate, a concept’s awareness and intention are implicit expressions of a universal, underlying force that drives the coherence, definition, and integration of all forms within reality.

Following this reasoning, if a point exists as a concept with awareness and intention, then its only natural action is to create another point, just as it was created. This is not arbitrary but a fundamental principle of *creation begets creation*, illustrating the recursive nature of A&I embedding itself into its manifestations.  This first act of creation therefore unfolds into the next, and the next, and so on.

Thus, what initially appeared as an unusual assertion, that a concept inherently possesses awareness and intention, is revealed, upon deeper reflection, as an inevitable truth. Furthermore, the first manifestation of this truth naturally emerges as a duality, elegantly exemplified by fundamental concepts like yin and yang or the binary pairing of 0 and 1, the simplest representation of the simplest duality; *nothing* and *something*.



## The Taijitu: Manifesting Duality and Creation


With this in mind, let’s reflect on the foundational principle of the I Ching: the polarity of yin and yang. Although this duality predates Taoism, the Taoist symbol of Yin and Yang (the *Taijitu*) visually embodies this essential concept. Remarkably, we recognize this same fundamental pattern echoed in nature itself, as shown in the striking similarity between the *Taijitu* and the cosmic microwave background radiation, an archetypal imprint of the immense energy released at the birth of our universe in the Big Bang.[^16]:


<center><img src='../Images/ic_yinyang.png' style='width:50%'/></center>

[^16]: **Delabrouille, Jacques.** *PSM Project: Planck Sky Model.* Université Paris Cité. Available at: https://apc.u-paris.fr/~delabrou/PSM/psm.html

This Taoist *Taijitu* symbol represents the duality that emerged from the oneness or monism of our 0D point (*blue-dot* or *N*-state), creating itself. The ancient *Tao Te Ching*[^27], written by Lao Tzu (~600 BCE), the founder of Taoism, explains quite simply and clearly how this progression advances:

*The Tao gives birth to One.* *One gives birth to Two.* *Two gives birth to Three.* *Three gives birth to the ten thousand things.*

[^27]: **Lao Tzu (trans. D.C. Lau).** *Tao Te Ching.* Penguin Classics, 1963

The initial duality emerging from the "One" occurs when the original 0D point inevitably creates another 0D point. This act of creation naturally happens because the original blue dot has no limitations or attributes other than its inherent awareness and intention, compelling it to replicate itself.  The first 0D point is equivalent to our *Negotiated* state of the blue dot, or *N*-state, and the second 0D point is the introduction of limitations, for without this green dot, the blue dot was unlimited, in a void of nothingness.  there is nothing out green dot, which is the

In our unthinkable thought experiment, the existence of a zero-dimensional point in nothingness might be considered a duality, that of the somethingness of a conceptual point and nothingness, but the nothingness itself did not exist as a concept prior to the appearance of the point. Strictly speaking, a conceptual point in nothingness is just a conceptual point. There is no duality, just the monism of the concept. So, while we can say that somethingness and nothingness, referring to the primal dot and the void it exists within, are the first duality, the fact that there is a concept of nothing proves this is inaccurate because the concept of nothing is itself something.

The more accurate description would be the duality of “Is” and “Is Not,” referring to the blue and green dot, because the creation of the green dot is the first instance of that which “Is Not” the blue dot, and the blue dot is the first instance of that which “Is”, which has no concept of that which “is not” if it is the only “is” in existence.

It might be a bit pedantic to argue the difference between *Is/Is Not* versus *somethingness/nothingness*, but that difference turns out to play a very critical role in the Tholonic model because the concept of nothingness is not at all a limiting concept. On the contrary, it represents absolute, the unlimited freedom with no limitation, while the concept of *Is Not* is essentially the archetype of limitation.

The Taijitu represents the duality that brings forth the “*ten thousand things*”.  We say this because, tholonically, the Taijitu is described as 1 tholon with 2 partons, each of those having 2 partons.  This creates 7 tholons over 3 generations <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/Taijitu-tholons_2.png" style='float:right;width:50%'/>that self-organize along the paths of least resistance to form an array that can be described by 3 hexagrams formed by 6 triangles.  Here, the Taijitu is yellow *n-state*, not a blue *N*-state, because it is the first child of the parent *N*-state, whiuch created the . This diagram shows clearly that the Taijitu is created by the joining of yin and yang, rather than being the creator so yin and yang.

What is significant here is that the I Ching’s Taijitu is the first *n-state* in the thologram, with the primary *N*-state being the “One” created by the Tao, the Awareness and Intention of creation. The only difference is that the Taijitu shows a dynamic of change, or negotiating (mixing), while the *n-state* represents a negotiated state (i.e., mixed red and green, yellow).


<center><img src='../Images/0_007.png' style='width:80%'/></center>

While one might initially assume *Awareness* and *Intention* constitute the first duality, practically speaking, they are not truly separate because neither can exist independently of the other. Instead, they represent two complementary perspectives of a single unified phenomenon, analogous to wave-particle duality in physics, where one underlying reality is perceived differently depending on context. In this unified view, awareness is the recognition of existence, and intention is the purposeful movement within that recognition; inseparable aspects of the fundamental process of conscious creation, neither of which can exist alone.

Rather than a duality, they form a self-referential singularity, where one perspective reveals awareness as the receptive aspect of existence, and the other reveals intention as its active counterpart. Awareness and intention are fundamentally one, appearing distinct only when expressed through a dualistic framework, the structure that enables differentiation.

The singularity itself does not split into awareness and intention; instead, differentiation emerges within an existing duality, giving rise to these aspects as distinct expressions. In this sense, duality is not created by the singularity but serves as its medium of manifestation, while the singularity itself remains whole and undivided. This medium arises through the singularity’s self-instantiation when the zero-dimensional dot creates a second dot and the first act of differentiation.

We can understand this through the linguistic concept of "I Am," where "I" represents the most basic expression of awareness—an identifying label for the self. However, as a noun, it is merely a passive designation. In contrast, "Am" is a verb that signifies the action of being, an active assertion of existence. Together, these two elements, the passive "I" and the active "Am", form the most fundamental declaration of identity and existence.

This mirrors the relationship between *awareness* and *intention* in the Tholonic model. Just as "I" passively denotes the presence of self-awareness, awareness itself represents the fundamental recognition of existence. Meanwhile, "Am" actively asserts being, paralleling *intention* as the dynamic force that drives expression and manifestation. In this way, "I Am" encapsulates the dual perspective of a singular principle of awareness as recognition and intention as the active force of becoming, perfectly aligning with the concept of a unified phenomenon perceived from two complementary angles.

Interestingly, this concept resonates with the biblical account where God revealed His name to Moses as "I Am" (in Hebrew, *Ehyeh Asher Ehyeh*, often translated as "I Am That I Am") in the Book of Exodus. This divine self-identification emphasizes pure existence and awareness as the source of all that is.

The conceptual parallels between the Tholonic model and traditions such as Taoist philosophy, Hermetic principles, and various mystical systems are striking. While these similarities might suggest the Tholonic model borrowed from these traditions, it was actually developed through an attempt to apply first principles reasoning to fundamental questions about the nature of energy—beyond just how energy behaves or can be measured.

Modern science excels at describing energy's properties and transformations through frameworks like quantum field theory and thermodynamics. However, science often treats the ultimate question of what energy fundamentally is as outside its domain, categorizing it as metaphysical or philosophical. The Tholonic model attempts to bridge this gap.

Science has made remarkable progress through empirical measurement and mathematical modeling, but faces inherent limitations when addressing phenomena that resist conventional measurement or exist beyond our current instrumentation capabilities. These limitations become especially apparent when considering propositions that challenge scientific materialism, such as the possibility that consciousness or awareness might be fundamental aspects of reality rather than emergent properties, or that seemingly inanimate matter might possess forms of proto-awareness.

The Tholonic model's convergence with ancient wisdom traditions may reflect that both approaches are grappling with the same underlying reality, albeit through different methodological lenses.



## Core Interactions of Existence: Practical Examples


In the Tholonic framework, all forms of existence are shaped by three fundamental interactions: negotiation, definition, and contribution. These forces influence every action, relationship, interaction, and transformation, whether referring to conceptual points in a void or galaxies and atoms.

In the context of our material reality, we see these three properties as: Work → Force → Distance, Pressure → Area → Force, Momentum → Mass → Velocity, Power → Voltage → Current, Wavelength → Frequency → Speed, Charge → Electric Field → Force, Temperature → Volume → Pressure, Stress → Strain → Elasticity, Density → Mass → Volume, Friction → Surface Roughness → Force, and many more.

*Work, Pressure, Momentum, Power, Wavelength, Charge, Temperature, Stress, Density, Friction*

- These properties are **Negotiation**-related because they all describe how different forces, energies, or influences balance and interact within a system to produce a resultant state or effect. They reflect the principle that stability and existence emerge from dynamic interplay, where contrasting or complementary elements find equilibrium or harmonize to sustain patterns or states.

*Force, Area, Mass, Voltage, Frequency, Electric Field, Volume, Strain, Mass, Surface Roughness*

- These properties represent **Limitation** or **Definition** because they set boundaries or constraints that shape how negotiation processes unfold. They act as limiting factors that determine the extent, intensity, or capacity of interactions within a system, defining how much force, area, mass, voltage, frequency, electric field, volume, strain, or surface roughness can influence the final outcome.

*Distance, Force, Velocity, Current, Speed, Force, Pressure, Elasticity, Volume, Force*

- These properties are associated with **Contribution** or **Integration** because they represent the final outcome or effect resulting from the interaction of negotiation and limitation factors. They manifest as the tangible or measurable result of balanced dynamics within a system, integrating the influences of previous processes into a coherent and stable state.

Some practical examples are:

**Newton’s Second Law of Motion**: In *F=ma*, *Force* maps to negotiation (balance) as the interaction that drives change, *mass* maps to limitation (definition) as the resistance or boundary that shapes the interaction, and *acceleration* maps to contribution (integration) as the resulting effect or output of the system.

**Theory of Special Relativity:** In *E = mc²*, *speed of light squared* (*C²*) maps to negotiation (balance) as the transformational factor that governs the interaction between mass and energy, *mass* (*M*) maps to limitation (definition) as the fundamental constraint or structure, and *energy* (*E*) maps to contribution (integration) as the resulting effect or emergent property.

**Ohm’s Law**: In *V=IR*, *Volts* (*V*) map to negotiation (balance) as the driving potential that enables interaction, *resistance* (*R*) maps to limitation (definition) as the resistance that constrains the flow, and *amps* (*I*) map to contribution (integration) as the resulting current that flows through the system.

**Atomic Theory**: *Neutrons* map to negotiation (balance) as they stabilize the atom without carrying charge, *protons* map to limitation (definition) as they define the atomic identity through positive charge and structure, and *electrons* map to contribution (integration) as they facilitate interactions, bonding, and energy exchange within and between atoms.

**Chaos, Order, Emergence[^14]**: *Chaos* maps to negotiation (balance) as the dynamic field of possibilities seeking equilibrium, *order* maps to limitation (definition) as the structured constraints that shape and stabilize interactions, and *emergence* maps to contribution (integration) as the resulting patterns, structures, or phenomena that arise from their interplay.

**Quantum Mechanics**: In quarks, *color charge* maps to negotiation (balance) as quarks must achieve a stable, color-neutral state, *flavor* maps to limitation (definition) as it determines the identity and role of each quark, and *strong interaction* (gluon exchange) maps to contribution (integration) as it binds quarks together to form stable particles.

# II: Foundations of the I Ching

## Patterns, Principles, and Structure


The I Ching’s trigrams, like the thologram’s triangle or triad, is seen as the concept of a the stable building block of structure. In the I Ching, a trigram is simply three states of yin/yang together to form a stable concept. There are eight possible combinations when using yin and yang (shown below).

<img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/i-ching-8.png" style='float:right;width:20%'/>The I Ching also has a concept of a “lower” and an “upper” state. It describes the lower state as earth, matter, the subjective, the hidden, the inner, etc. depending on context, and the “upper” state as that of heaven, ideas, archetypes, the outer, exposed and the arena of creation, etc, also depending on context. Just as the yin and yang lines represent the two states of something, the upper and lower trigrams represent the two states of the stable concept created by the three lines of the trigram. Already we see the self-similar properties of dualities of trinities as shown in the thologram as well.

Pairing these eight upper trigrams with the eight lower trigrams results in a total of 64 hexagrams, shown below (even values are blue, odd values are red for easier viewing). The number under the hexagram is the binary value of the hexagram when considering yin as 0 and yang as 1. This was the original Fu Xi arrangement before the current King Wen (~1154 BCE, Zhou Dynasty) order was introduced.

<center><img src='../Images/ic_64hex.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

While there are 64 hexagrams, it is more useful to think of two different sets of 32 pairs of hexagrams. The reason this is more useful is that we can consider these 32 pairs as 32 singularities that instantiate in two different forms depending on the context.

##### Note: For clarity, referring to hexagrams can take the following form of **2䷁*~0~* the *Receptive***, where **2** is the traditional or King Wen number of the hexagram, **䷁** is the hexagram itself, and the small-italic ***~0~*** is the binary value of the hexagrams when yang=1 and yin=0. The name, ***Receptive***, is the traditional name, which may differ from the Tholonic I Ching name. Unless noted, all the hexagram name in this document are the traditional names.

For example, take the most basic hexagrams: 2䷁*~0~* the *Receptive*, and 1䷀*~63~* the *Creative*. Between these two hexagrams, all other hexagrams exist, so together, as a pair, they represent one state that includes the broadest context that everything exists within. Another example is the pair of hexagrams 39䷦*~20~* *Obstruction*, which states, “*When faced with dangerous obstacles it is wise to retreat and prepare accordingly with those of like mind*,” and its opposite, 38䷥*~43~* *Diverging Perspectives* or *Opposition*, which states, “*When opposites meet they must proceed with care, for brusqueness will lead to calamity, but through understanding and cooperation we can change an opposition into a polarity. This is how all things come into being*.”

The *meta* concept here is one of opposites and how they can interact either through polarity as cooperation or conflict.  We examine these pairs further on, but for now it it useful to keep this concept in mind.



## Mapping Trigrams to the Tholonic Model


##### *Note: To avoid confusion, a tholonic triple, which is essentially a triangle, is called a “triad” to distinguish from the I Ching’s “trigram”.*

A tholonic triad is a bit different from, but quite compatible with, the I Ching trigram. Instead of three states that the I Ching defines as beginning, middle, end, or earth, man, heaven, the triad is made of a source and the two polar opposites that emerge from that source, something like a *synthesis* that holds within it its own but yet unexpressed   *thesis* and *antithesis*. The three lines of a trigram and the three points of a triad correlate with *NDC*.

The thologram also has a concept of *upper* and *lower* in that the *upper* trigram of the I Ching, which comes *after* the *lower* trigram, equates nicely to the *child* triad of a tholon, which comes *after* or *within* the parent. In other words, the *lower* I Ching trigram is the *parent* triad of the thologram, and the *upper* I Ching trigram is the *child* triad of the tholon. We can now see that the final hexagram is perfectly equivalent to a 2D tholon map.


<center><img src='../Images/tri-is-hex.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

It might seem counterintuitive that the *upper* or *outer* trigrams of the I Ching equate to the smaller embedded triads of the thologram, but in the tholon it is the smallest and most embedded tholons that represent the bleeding edge of reality where new creations are being born, dying, and morphing. The farther “up” the thologram, the more fundamental the changes. In the thologram, the parent triad is what forms the environment or context for a new negotiated (i.e., stable) instance to come into existence, so the parent triad is the incubator, so to speak, for the yet-to-be-manifest *N*-state and its own duality. The smaller, inner triad inside the parent is where the newly created *N*-state creates its own environment, which incubates yet another *N*-state, and so on.

If the thologram recurses inward and not outward, does this mean that all creations exist *within* the initial tetrahedron, or tholon, that is created by this primal; parent and child triad? Conceptually, yes, within which are an infinite number of embedded tetrahedrons across an infinite number of generations.

##### Note: One interesting detail is when we use the outer triad on the parent level with the inner triad on the child level; all the numbers, as indicated on the image above, for each side equal 9, (1+6+2), (2+4+3), (3+5+1), but if we associated the lower trigram with the inner triad, and the upper trigram with the outer triad, all the numbers for each side equal 12, (4+3+5), (5+1+6), (6+2+4). 9 is a smaller number and is more efficiently expressed and is self-similar  (3<sup>3</sup>) unlike 12, which means it has “less resistance” than the larger, less sophisticated, and more complex 12 (2<sup>2</sup>×3 - see appendix for more on this). That does not mean other mappings are incorrect, just that this one is the most efficient and therefore more likely to occur.



## The Six Stages (I Ching and Thologram)


According to the I Ching, there are 6 stages of change that describe the life-cycle of a creation or instance. This is stated very clearly:

-   *“All movements are accomplished in **six stages**, and the seventh brings return.”*

*<sub>~Hexagram 24 “Return”</sub>*

-   “The holy man, who understands the mysteries of creation inherent in end and beginning, becomes superior to the limitations of the transitory. For him, the meaning of time is that in it, the stages of growth can unfold in a clear sequence. He is mindful at every moment and uses the **six stages of growth** as if they were six dragons on which he mounts to heaven.”

*<sub>~Commentary on hexagram 1, the Creative (Wilhelm/Baynes edition).</sub>*

This shows a general idea of the six steps from an I Ching and tholonic perspective. We can see these same six stages in modern applications, one of the many examples being the popular *Transtheoretical Model*[^24] used for addressing issues of growth, recovery, behavior, production, etc. We will use these archetypal qualities as properties of the six lines, not simply because it’s a reasonable presumption, but because the original I Ching texts support these definitions, as will be shown.

[^24]: Prochaska, J. O., & Velicer, W. F. (1997). The Transtheoretical Model of Health Behavior Change. American Journal of Health Promotion, 12(1), 38–48. https://doi.org/10.4278/0890-1171-12.1.38

To show these similarities, we will use the hexagram 63䷾*~21~* *After Completion*, which represents the “perfect” or ideal order of the hexagrams.


<center><img src='../Images/simple_lines-1.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

Here is another way to look at the tholonic/I Ching relationship:


<center><img src='../Images/line-tao.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

One way to understand the 6 stages is by looking at the 6 steps of bifurcation needed to create 64 children from one source. Notice how the 1<sup>st</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> level of bifurcation (blue shaded line) are the tholonic *Negotiation* line, which is the only area where new *N*-states can form to create potential tholons. These lines are the lines of the archetypes of *Inception* and *Emergence*, representing the starting line of each of the two trigrams.


<center><img src='../Images/ic-btree-labels.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

Another way of looking at the 6 stages is by comparison. In the image below, I have tried to select the best concepts to map together solely based on what “made sense” to me. I am sure there is a better, more verifiable metric to base these on, so these are shown as examples, not as claims.

In the “Tholon” diagram below, the numbers in the center triangle are in their tholonic order of 0, 5, 1, 3, 2, 4, and in the other two diagrams, they are in the I Ching order of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.


<center><img src='../Images/colorfog-tri2.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

Look at the numbered triangle in the “Plant Instance” above. Note the qualities of the points that form the corners (which are yang in nature), such as 1, 3, and 5 (GERMINATE, BLOOM, SEED) that form the connecting lines (which are yin in nature) 2, 4, and 6 (growth, fruiting, recycle). Look at the quality of the pairs that are composed of a point and its opposite line. For example, there are three such pairs: GERMINATE/fruiting, BLOOM/recycle, and SEED/growth. We can understand these pairs as the conceptual polarities of the 3 parent concepts:

-   **The Beginning** (germination, reproduction)
-   **The Limits** (blooming and death)
-   **The Work**: What “it must do” as an existence (it must sustain its existence, i.e., produce seeds, growth).

In the Tholonic order of numbers, each side and its points equals 6,6,6, while in the I Ching order, they equal 6, 12, 12.   Both follow a similar pattern where 6×6×6 = 216, and 6×12×12=864=216×4, but 6^3^ is more symmetrical, balanced, self-similar, simpler, and comes with a host of references that work well for this model, which includes mathematical properties[^28][^29], number symbolism[^22][^23], astronomical relevance [^19], religious and mystical references[^17][^18], and the (likelihood)  that Plato called 216 the "Perfect Number"[^20][^21].

There is yet another way to look at the structure of the lines, and one that is arguably the basis of the current King Wen interpretation of the I Ching.


<center><img src='../Images/dot-cicrle-ary.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

***Fig. k1*** shows a simple binary tree that starts at the center and bifurcates outward to 64 end-points. This form is especially useful because it so clearly shows the direction of the YIN movement (***Fig. k2a***) and the YANG movement (***Fig. k2b***), and when we add these two opposite moving patterns together we can see an impressive self-similar fractal pattern (***Fig. k3***). ***Fig. k4*** shows the dots and the lines together, but in addition, each of the six concentric bands has been colorized according to their *NDC* correlation, and the connective lines have been greatly thickened, with a Taijitu symbol added to the middle to represent the original duality.


<center><img src='../Images/dot-circle-anatomy.png' style='width:80%'/></center>

Each of these concentric rings represents each successive bifurcation, which defines each of the lines in a hexagram. The above image shows the path from the beginning to the end for hexagram 5䷄*~23~* *Waiting/Nourishment*.

Below are all 64 hexagrams represented and the paths of the cardinal point highlighted, producing a star-chart where the innermost value is the octal (base-8) value in mono-spaced text. The next ring of values is the binary value in decimal, then the King Wen name of the hexagram, and then the King Wen number of the hexagram.

<center><img src='../Images/dot-circle-64.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

This structure tells us a lot about the I Ching. For example, this sequence is the most naturally occurring pattern, and by natural, we mean the most organically formed and the most obvious in nature itself as well as following the *law of least energy*. In this <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/64-plot.png" style='float:right;width:30%'/>pattern, we can clearly see the fractal and self-similar nature of the pattern that is made obvious by the procession of the octal values, which follows a pattern shown on the right of two identical sets that are naturally offset by an X value of 1. We can also see the four major cardinal points (North, East, West, South) hold a unique value that clearly identifies them as cardinal in nature, as do the clear but different values that identify the minor cardinal points (NE, NW, SE, SW). Notice every hexagram has its perfect opposite value (i.e., both values sum to 63) on the horizontally opposite side.

To see this last example better, we highlighted the paths of each of the cardinal and semi-cardinal paths and show the hexagrams they produce along with their traditional name and meaning as per Wilhelm/Baynes[^13], with their traditional King Wen sequence number in parentheses.

[^13]: **Wilhelm, Richard, and Cary F. Baynes, trans.** *The I Ching or Book of Changes.* Princeton University Press, 1967

On the right, we show the overarching theme of the two hexagrams that join at the cardinal points.


<center><img src='../Images/dot-circle-3a-2.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

In addition, each perfect pair (a hexagram and its inverse form together) has its own *theme* or *context* that exists with these cardinal themes. In other words, in the context of the cardinal themes, it is the two adjacent hexagrams that define it, even though the hexagrams may not be a perfect pair, while the 32 perfect pairs are made of only perfectly inverse or opposite hexagrams. One interesting observation, of the 8 cardinal pair themes and the 32 pair themes, the only pairs that are the same in both contexts are 2䷁*~0~* ***Receptive*** ⇔ 1䷀*~63~* **CREATIVE** and 24䷗*~1~* ***Return*** ⇔ 44䷫*~62~* **COMING TO MEET**, which are the first 2 of the of the 32 pairs and also define the limits of the entire I Ching, suggesting that this pair defines an even broader parent theme of “Movement within duality.”

Here is a brief overview of this fundamental concept of pairs in the I Ching, specifically, the concepts of *ascending* and *descending* hexagrams.

***Ascending*** hexagrams have a yin line in the 6<sup>th</sup> place and have a binary value less than 32, and are shown in italics-bold for easy identification.

**DESCENDING** hexagrams have a yang line in the 6<sup>th</sup> place and a binary value greater than 31, and are shown in all caps-bold.

These classifications of ascending and descending come from the observation that ascending hexagrams represent the movement from pure yin, 2䷁*~0~* ***Receptive***, to the maximum yang that can be supported before it can no longer be classified as ascending, or 43䷪*~31~* ***Breakthrough***. Likewise, descending hexagrams represent a pure yang state 1䷀*~63~* **CREATIVE**, to the minimum yin state that can be supported, 23䷖*~32~* **DISSOLUTION**.

The ascending accumulates yang and the descending disseminates yang. This is a concept that the King Wen authors must have also seen as it is evident in their interpretations that show:

- ***Ascending*** hexagrams represent processes that culminate in openness to transformation, alignment with larger forces, and acceptance of natural cycles. They emphasize receptivity, adaptation, and harmony with circumstances beyond personal control.

- **DESCENDING** hexagrams represent processes that culminate in assertion, definition, and extension of influence, and emphasize initiative, structure, and the application of will to shape circumstances.

For example, 46䷭*~6~* ***Pushing Upward*** represents the accumulation of yang through gradual, persistent effort of growth that succeeds through receptivity to natural cycles, like a plant pushing upward through soil, while its paired opposite, 25䷘*~57~* **INNOCENCE**, represents the dissemination of yang, spontaneous, natural action aligned with cosmic order, where one's inner integrity manifests as outer success through the power of acting without calculated intent.

In the most mundane and limited context, we can think of *Ascending* as the “cards you are dealt” in a game you are attempting to win at, and the **DESCENDING** as how you choose to play those cards that will bring you closer to your goal.

Tholonically speaking, the ascending hexagrams embody the principle of *Limitation*/*Definition* as they represent the contextual boundaries and natural cycles that define our scope of possibility and the larger forces beyond personal control that we must recognize and adapt to achieve sustainability. Conversely, the descending hexagrams embody the principle of Contribution/Integration as they represent how we actively contribute to our reality, and it’s limitations, through assertion, initiative, and the application of will to shape outcomes. This relationship creates a dynamic spectrum: ascending hexagrams establish the contextual limitations within which we operate, while descending hexagrams demonstrate how we integrate with and contribute to that context.

Just as Limitation and Contribution define the spectrum across which all negotiated states come into existence in the Tholonic model, these two complementary classes of hexagrams define the entire spectrum of possibilities that all 64 hexagrams represent, each showing a unique relationship between accepting the limitations of our context and actively contributing to it.

For reference, here is the list of all 32 pairs that represent the ascending and descending aspects of the parent concept, or “Path Name.”

<center><img src='../Images/32pairs-0.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

See the appendix for a more thorough analysis of the relationship between the polar and binary order.

Referring back to the circular star-chart, ***Fig. Star-1***, the first thing we notice is that the exact opposites of 2䷁*~0~* ***Receptive*** and 1䷀*~63~* **CREATIVE** begin and end the cycle at the top. Their opposite pair, at the bottom, is made up of the opposite hexagrams of 24䷗*~1~* the ***Return*** and 44䷫*~62~* **COMING TO MEET**. Considering this is exactly the point where the cycle begins to return, it suggests that the King Wen interpreters of the I Ching saw this same pattern.

We can also see that each pair of hexagrams for the same point has a meaning that is similar from two different aspects. In ***Fig. Star-2***, we have renamed these points according to the theme they share, or what we also refer to as the *path name*. Further on, we look at how this was arrived at.

The other thing we notice is the symmetry of the numbers, wherein every pair of opposite (ascending/descending) values on opposite sides of the vertical axis always equals 63, for example 25䷘*~57~* **INNOCENCE** and 46䷭*~6~* ***Pushing Upwards*** where 57 + 6 = 63. The same is true for every lower and upper trigram and their opposite equaling 7, but in the case of the ascending trigrams, the axis is diagonal from the lowest right sector to the highest left sector, and for the descending trigrams, the axis is mirrored, from lowest left to the highest right sector.

<img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/dot-circle-3a-2_axis.png" style='float:right;width:40%'/>These axes are not easily visualized, so here is a diagram, and, as we can see, the lower trigram connections follow crossed, diverging paths suggesting dynamism or tension, while the upper trigram connections form a more ordered, symmetrical geometric pattern suggesting stability and structure. This visual difference could represent the contrasting nature or functions of the upper and lower trigrams in I Ching philosophy, with lower trigrams potentially representing more dynamic, changing inner conditions and upper trigrams representing more structured, manifest outer conditions.  This is consistent with the concept that the lower trigrams is the more formative “inner” and the upper trigram is the more manifest “outer.”

Here is an overview of the cardinal pairs shown above, using the traditional King Wen hexagram titles and meanings

-   Pair 1)  1䷀*~63~* **CREATIVE** ⇔ 2䷁*~0~* ***Receptive***
-   - Both of these hexagrams define a genesis, the origin of creation, the primordial duality that forms the foundation of existence, where active creation and passive reception combine to give rise to all things.  This is where pure, dynamic force (CREATIVE) joins with the yielding, nurturing (Receptive), allowing creation to take form.  This polarity that defines the spectrum within which every other hexagrams exists.
      
    
-   Pair 2) 10䷉*~59~* **TREADING** ⇔ 7䷊*~11~* **Peace***
-   - Both of these describe a time when the high and the low are in **harmony**. In one case (*Peace*), a state of balance and harmonious coexistence , and in the other (TREADING), it is the result of decorum and when pleasant manners succeed in maintaining harmony and balance while navigating potential difficulties.
      
    
-   Pair 3) 13䷌*~61~* **FELLOWSHIP** ⇔ 19䷒*~3~* ***Approach***
-   - Both hexagrams speak of **connection**. In one case (*Approach*), there is the idea of coming closer, drawing near, or moving toward a goal or relationship, emphasizing building rapport or establishing presence. The other case (FELLOWSHIP) speaks of unity, communal effort, and forming bonds with others, emphasizing working together harmoniously.
      
    
-   Pair 4)  25䷘*~57~* **INNOCENCE** ⇔ 36䷣*~5~* ***Darkening of the Light***
-   - Both hexagrams refer to staying true to oneself and holding steadfast to one’s principles and **integrity**. finding the inner light for **guidance**. In one case (*Darkening*), enduring adversity while preserving one’s inner truth, maintaining integrity despite external suppression or hardship,  and in the other (INNOCENCE), acting with pure intention and maintaining authenticity, being aligned with natural virtue and unaffected by ulterior motives.
      
    
-   Pair 5) 44䷫*~62~* **COMING TO MEET** ⇔ 24䷗*~1~* ***Return***.
-   - Both hexagrams speak of a **reversing course**. In one case (*Return*), it is the natural turn of the cycle when the light returns to the darkness. In the other (COMING TO MEET), it is the result of a decision but warns one of allowing the inferior to gain access to the superior. However, it also admits that this meeting of “inferior” and “superior” is what brings about all life.
      
    
-   Pair 6) 6䷅*~58~* **CONFLICT** ⇔ 46䷭*~6~*  ***Pushing Upwards***
-   - Both hexagrams speak of **resolution** if progress is to succeed. In the one case (*Pushing Upward*), steady progress and advancement despite obstacles, emphasizing overcoming challenges with determination. In the other, (CONFLICT), speaks of struggles, disputes, and opposition, emphasizing the need to address and resolve differences.
      
    
-   Pair 7) 33䷠*~60~* **RETREAT** ⇔ 7䷆*~2~* ***Army***
-   - Both hexagrams speak of **strategy**. In one case (*Army*), an organized effort and disciplined action toward a goal, emphasizing strategic planning and collective force. In the other (RETREAT), withdrawing strategically to regroup or preserve strength, emphasizing calculated movement to avoid unnecessary conflict.
      
    
-   Pair 8) 12䷋*~56~* **STANDSTILL** ⇔ 15䷎*~4~* ***Modesty***.
-   - Both hexagrams describe a time of **restraint**. In one case (*Modesty*), humility and self-restraint, emphasizing the importance of not overreaching or asserting oneself excessively. In the other case (STANDSTILL), stagnation or blocked progress, emphasizing the need to remain calm and composed despite inactivity or obstacles.

These cardinal pairs can be reduced again to a more abstracted four pairs, and they can be reduced further to two, which would be the duality from which everything emerges. I argue here that this duality is the same duality that everything evolved from as well, that of *Definition* and *Contribution*, and everything exists as a result of *Negotiation* between those two states.  In this graph, all *Limitation/Definition* “green dot” words are green and the *Contribution/Integration* “red dot” words are red.  Uppercase have descending properties and lowercase have ascending properties, but keep in minds that we are attempting to show 4 generations of embedded ascending/descending and integrating/limiting properties, which is next to impossible in two dimensions.

<center><img src='../Images/revtree_v4.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

Although not shown here, applying this same reductionism to the 32 pairs result is a primal pair *Limitation/Definition* and *Contribution/Integration*, and to ensure objectivity in this process, all reductions were done by AI[^25] whose only input was the Wilhelm Bayes English translation of the I Ching and whose only request was to find the concept encompasses both child concepts.

## Understanding the Six Lines


There are not 6 lines in order to make 64 hexagrams; there are 64 hexagrams because there are 6 lines. The creators of the I Ching deliberately chose to use 6 lines because they knew that 6 is the minimum needed to create a complete archetype. Six represents the smallest complete structure that balances complexity and stability, reflecting mathematical perfection (as the first perfect number) and geometric integrity (as the edges of a tetrahedron). It forms the minimal set of binary interactions necessary to cover all dual possibilities, allowing for a dynamic interplay of yin and yang while maintaining structural balance and coherence. Hence, the six lines of a hexagram symbolize the progression from potential to fulfillment, capturing the full cycle of transformation and completeness inherent in an archetypal pattern, yet represented in the smallest possible model.

This is an idea that we see not only across many cultures all over the world, specifically in their stories of creation, but in science and geometry:

> -   The simplest three dimensional form requires 6 lines connecting 4 points (the tetrahedron).
>
> -   The Abrahamic traditions (i.e., Torah, Old Testament, Quran) say all of creation was accomplished in 6 days.
>
> -   The Babylonian creation myth, the Enuma Elis, where the one God created 6 gods, each in charge of the 6 different aspects of creation (where they spent 2 days creating everything and the rest of their days fighting with each other).
>
> -   The original Greek Titans were 6 men (Oceanus, Coeus, Crius, Hyperion, Iapetus, and Cronus), and their sisters, the Titanides (Theia, Rhea, Themis, Mnemosyne, Phoebe, and Tethys). They were all the children of the original 2 primordial gods, Uranus (primordial sky) and Gaia (primordial earth).
>
> -   In the building blocks of creation (chemistry) we see 6 electrons in carbon, the foundation of life.
>
> -   The archetype of the *N*-source, blue dot, from which all children emerge, has a value of 6, and its two children are 2 (*Definition*/*Limitation*) and 3 (*Contribution*/*Integration*).<img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/planisphere-nineveh-2.png" style='float:right;width:20%'/>

6 seems to be a very significant number and is firmly associated with the concept of creation. The utility of the number 6 is probably why the Sumerians invented a base-6 system, which we still use today (360°, 24 hours, 12 months), which they used to plot the stars with surprising accuracy, as we know from the *Planisphere of Nineveh* (right), and calculated values in the trillions (of what, we don’t know).

Below is a chart that shows a more in-depth description of the 6 steps from a tholonic and I Ching perspective. It is divided into two trigrams, *lower* and *upper*. Pay attention to the similarity of the three concepts that each line in the trigram shares with each other, as they are essentially mirror aspects of one another.

##### Note: It is both difficult and misleading to use one word to define an archetype that can have many different instances, nevertheless, we do exactly that, but remind the reader that these words are simply hints of a much larger significance.


<center><img src='../Images/line-desc-1.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

Once we cross the line from *lower* to the *upper*, the quality of the line positions flip, making what was **yang** in the *lower* trigram **yin** in the *upper* trigram, and vice versa. In the tholon, we see this same reversal in the children tholons, *reflection* triads, and *virtual* tholons.


<center><img src='../Images/line-desc-2.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

Here we equate the *upper* and *lower* trigrams of the I Ching to the three tholonic attributes of *N*, *D*, and *C*.


<center><img src='../Images/tho-table.png' style='width:80%'/></center>

Depending on the context (*upper* or *lower*), *N*, *D*, and *C* have slightly different expressions. In the most general sense, *N*, *D*, and *C* can represent many different concepts depending on their context.


<center><img src='../Images/tho-table-2.png' style='width:80%'/></center>

Because the I Ching is about the nature of unending change, it might serve us to view the stages of change as a continuous stream of change in the form of a wave, which we attempt to do in the image below


<center><img src='../Images/6stage-side-front.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

This continuity is consistent with the I Ching when it states: “*All movements are accomplished in six stages, and the seventh brings return.*” Here we see how the seventh stage returns us to the first stage of the next cycle. Another validation of using this waveform as a model is that the lower trigram of lines 1, 2, and 3 is, in fact, in the lower part of the waveform, and the upper trigram of 4, 5, and 6 is in the upper part.

This lower and upper assignment is not arbitrary; it is the result of the natural alignment of the dominant Yang line, which is position 5, being at the top, and the dominant Yin line, which is position 2, being at the bottom, and both aligned across the vertical axis.

On the right is a front view of the waveform that shows how the cycle is composed of six stages that alternate between yin (orange) and yang (blue). Within one complete cycle, we have highlighted the significant axis and their yin and yang properties. Using the archetypal yin/yang values for the six lines, we see that the upper half, being outward in nature, and the left half, being ascending in nature, are both yang. The lower half, being inner in nature, and the right half, being descending in nature, are both yin. This results in four quadrants that are, respectively, yin-yin (`00`<img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/bigram00.png" style='width:35px'/> or 0), yin-yang (`10`<img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/bigram01.png" style='width:35px'/> or 2), yang-yang (`11`<img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/bigram11.png" style='width:35px'/> or 3), and yang-yin (`01`<img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/bigram01.png" style='width:35px'/> or 1), which are shown in each corner as bigrams.

It might seem odd that the cycle starts at the 4:00 position on the circular chart, and not the 6:00 or 12:00 position, but the positions of the lines were determined by their yin/yang qualities. The vertical axis is the only axis that aligns with the 6 axes of the lines, and as line 2 is a yin line within a yin hemisphere, it naturally represents the nadir. The same is true for its opposite, line 5.

Interesting side note: in Christian monasticism, traditional Chinese medicine, some military and agricultural traditions, and even human hormonal cycles, 4:00 AM is considered the start of a new day, just as the yin cycle flips to a yang cycle at 4:00, making the final yin stage a perfect correlate to the Medieval folklore and Christian traditions that “devil’s hour” ends at 4:00 AM.

## The Form of Hexagrams


We can easily recognize this same archetypal structure of the I Ching and the tholon in many systems, from the process of mitosis to the shape of trees and plants with their *inner* roots and *outer* branches and leaves. This is significant because in the thologram there is a similar concept with a real tholon and a virtual tholon which are matched to create a complete tholon. We also saw an example of this in the book “THOLONIA - The Mechanics of Existential Awareness” when looking at how the complete tholon models quarks to the proton.

In the thologram, all odd-numbered tholons are *real* and all even-numbered tholons are *virtual*. Likewise, all hexagrams that begin with a yin line are even-numbered hexagrams, and those that begin with a yang line are odd-numbered. We now have a very clean mapping between the thologram and the I Ching of *virtual* as yin and *real* as yang.

We arrived at the same results of 6 fundamental concepts formed by a pair of triads from two completely different processes: the process of the thologram was based on creating a tetrahedron from a point, while the I Ching is based solely on the binary system.

There are many mappings and similarities between the tholon and the I Ching, but I will only show one more because it not only maps hexagrams to tholons but to basic physical structures in nature

<img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/overlay-gen.png" style='float:right;width:50%'/>If we create a binary tree of the I Ching where the bifurcations follow the path of least resistance, meaning they will always move into the emptiest space, we end up with bifurcations separated by 60° (which is also the angle that creates a tetrahedron/tholon). This would then create the patterns (right) for each of the 6 generations of bifurcations.

Simply splitting one line into two lines, in accordance with the laws of laws of least energy, we naturally form a pattern of hexagons that matches the pattern of tholonic expansion. This is because the I Ching and the thologram represent the same laws but in the context of a binary system (I Ching) and a trinary or synergetic system (thologram). Not surprisingly, the one point they both naturally center around is the *N*-source.

The image below is a more in-depth version showing the expansion of the I Ching’s lines from 1 to 6, and beyond. In this image, we follow each bifurcation starting with the one point from which the original duality emerged. The arrows show the direction of the movement, with left-sided (or *port* side, as the side is relative to the direction of the arrow) arrows as yin and right-sided (or *starboard* side) arrows as yang (or vice versa). Doubled-headed arrows indicate that one line (in the same direction) is shared by two parents, and lines with arrows in both directions indicate a shared line that is bidirectional.


<center><img src='../Images/hex_builder.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

***Fig. hb1*** shows the paths of all 64 hexagrams of the I Ching which are the result of 6 generations. ***Fig hb2*** shows the 7th generation. This is added only to show that with the 7th generations we get the first complete closure of a hexagram (the first one, in the center), which is another example of the “*All movements are accomplished in six stages, and the **seventh** brings return*”. ***Fig hb3*** is the same pattern, but iterated over 13 generations, generating 8,192 (or 2<sup>13</sup>) final values. It is included simply to show how the larger form remains a hexagram and how only the last two generations (purple and cyan) are even visible, occluding all previous generations. Notice how at this point, the dominant pattern, which will remain the dominant pattern for all future children, are two sets of three double-headed arrows, one set from the final generation (right), and one from the previous generation (left), shown in this image<img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/triplet-pairs.png" style='width:30px'/>pattern of 2×3 (final generations × intersections of movement) does not appear until the 2<sup>3</sup> (or 8<sup>th</sup>) generation. Because new generations overlap the previous when shown in two dimensions, we can’t see that this is really more of a 3D design, with the originating point in the center, expanding with each generation, creating a hexagonal cone.

This pattern of 6 triangles also happens to be two tetrahedrons that perfectly describe the shape of the thologram, i.e., two tholons, one *real* and one *virtual*, connected at the base. Yes, this is purely the result of the properties of geometry, but as the I Ching ands the thologram are built upon the same laws, we would expect to see such interrelated patterns.

Also of interest in this diagram is how it shows that the original *N*-source is the result of its own creation *after* 6 generations. In other words, after 6 generations, a new *N*-source is created in the same location as the original *N*-source, creating a new cycle that *departs* from the previous. Notice that it is the 5<sup>th</sup> place where two different cycles come together for the first time, which is why the 5<sup>th</sup> place is one of *integration*.

All of this is to demonstrate how the two systems are quite compatible to the point where not only can the entire I Ching be mapped to the thologram, but the thologram can greatly elaborate on the I Ching and give it a 3D structure, and given its recursive nature, infinitely so.
# III: Mapping the I Ching

## Tholonic Patterns of Creation and Transformation


The I Ching, according to the Tholonic model, has two “directions”: ascending and descending. The ascending direction consists of the first 32 binary values, while the descending direction consists of the following 32 binary values.

In the Tholonic model, the natural order of change follows this progression: Low-entropy chaos → order and complexity → high-entropy chaos.

A good example of this pattern is the progression of the universe from the Big Bang to its ultimate fate. The universe begins in a state of low-entropy chaos (the Big Bang), expands and develops increasing order and complexity, and eventually declines into high-entropy chaos, such as Heat Death, the Big Freeze, the Big Rip, Vacuum Decay, the Black Hole Era, and Hawking Radiation Evaporation, as all structure dissipates, according to these theories.

A good example of this pattern is the progression of the universe from the Big Bang to its ultimate fate. The universe begins in a state of low-entropy chaos (the Big Bang), expands and develops increasing order and complexity, and eventually declines into high-entropy chaos, such as Heat Death, the Big Freeze, the Big Rip, Vacuum Decay, the Black Hole Era, and Hawking Radiation Evaporation, as all structure dissipates, according to these theories.

As a reminder, the ascending side of the I Ching is where we move from the ultimate Yin state, [*2䷁~0~ **Receptive***], to the maximum Yang state that can exist in the Yin domain, [*43䷪~31~ **Breakthrough***]. The descending side begins as [23䷖~32~ **Splitting Apart**], the maximum Yin state that can exist in the Yang domain, and continues to the ultimate Yang state of [1䷀~63~ **The Creative**].

This model indicates that ䷁ and ䷀ are the two states of maximum chaos, the Yin chaos of maximum entropy and the Yang chaos of minimum entropy. It may seem odd to associate Yin with low entropy and Yang with high entropy, but the reasoning is as follows:

Receptivity (䷁) is the most compatible with low entropy because it represents a state of maximum potential, where energy remains unstructured and available for directed transformation. Like a vacuum that can accommodate limitless expansion, an all-Yin system has no imposed direction or movement, meaning it holds the greatest capacity for ordered, purposeful development. Since low entropy corresponds to a system where energy is highly concentrated and has not yet been dispersed, receptivity aligns perfectly with this principle, as it provides the ideal environment for structured emergence without yet engaging in full expression.

Creation (䷀) is the most compatible with high entropy because it represents the full expression and expansion of energy into its maximum form. With all lines being Yang, there is no room left for additional directed movement, meaning the system has reached its most fully realized, high-entropy state. In this sense, creation aligns with high entropy because energy has been fully utilized and distributed, leaving no latent potential for further directed transformation. Like a star that has burned through its fuel, creation signifies a state where all available energy has been expressed, requiring a return to receptivity for renewal.

This diagram shows the order of pairs and the entire sequence (the 10 red pairs of hexagrams have a balance of three Yin and three Yang)


<center><img src='../Images/0_008.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

This seems to suggest that the ultimate end of the Universe is represented by [1䷀~63~ **Creative**], which seems contrary to reason, but here is the reasoning that supports this idea.

The [1䷀~63~ **Creative**] is the universe at its most complete, the culmination of all possible expression. It is the final state in which energy has been fully structured, fully realized, and fully spent. Nothing more can be created because everything that could exist has already emerged. All differentiation, all movement, all transformation has reached its peak, leaving no further possibilities for change. In this moment, the universe is absolute, total, and without remainder, a condition so complete that nothing new can enter, nothing old can be undone. It is a moment of pure finality, where all that has been set into motion has played out its course, and what remains is a universe that has nothing left to become.

In the Tholonic model, the paradox of "Creation = Destruction" arises from the fundamental nature of Yang energy, which inherently expands, transforms, and consumes. Yang is the creative, active, and dynamic force, but by its very nature, it drives toward maximum entropy—the ultimate dissipation and dissolution of structure and energy. This is why fire, as a metaphor for creative energy, results in ash—it burns brightly and transforms its fuel into residual matter, leaving behind entropy and emptiness.

In the cosmic sense, Yang-driven processes lead to high-entropy end states, such as heat death, the big freeze, vacuum decay, or black hole evaporation. These scenarios reflect Yang energy pushing the universe toward the ultimate dispersal of order and structure. Thus, the beginning of creation inherently contains the seed of its own dissolution—the very act of creating and manifesting eventually consumes the energy that sustains it.

The resolution to this paradox lies in the interplay between Yang and Yin. While Yang initiates and expands, Yin conserves, preserves, and regenerates. The destruction of one creation gives rise to potential new forms, much like ashes enriching the soil for new growth. In this sense, destruction is not the antithesis of creation but its inevitable counterpart, completing the cycle where creation transforms into dissolution, and dissolution becomes the fertile ground for new creation.

Therefore, Creation and Destruction are not opposites but aspects of a single continuous process—the eternal cycle of transformation, where fire becomes ash, and ash nurtures new life. The creative force both initiates and concludes, embodying the dynamic balance between expansion and entropy.

When all has been fully realized, there is no longer movement, and when movement ceases, the conditions for a new cycle arise. The Creative, in exhausting itself, returns to [*2䷁~0~ **Receptive***], not as a separate phase, but as the inevitable consequence of total expression. The universe at its most complete is indistinguishable from the universe before it was born. The final expression is not merely an end; it is a return to the pure potential from which everything emerges.

Thus, the greatest fullness and the greatest emptiness are the same. The ultimate creation and the formless void are not opposites, but two ways of perceiving a singular reality, just as a zero dimensional point and a point of infinite dimensions are indistinguishable from each other. One is the last moment before dissolution, the other is the first moment before formation, but thermodynamically, they are identical, as potential for change is zero in both cases. What we call an ending is nothing but the stillness before a new beginning, and what we call a beginning is only the next emergence of movement from that stillness. The Creative, having fully expressed itself, does not collapse into nothingness, it *becomes nothingness*, and in doing so, it prepares for creation once more.

Lao Tzu not only alludes to this duality of oneness when describing the nature of the Tao, but is quite clear that the end of one begets the other, alternating in sequence, each being the cause and the effect of the other.

> ##### As soon as beauty is known by the world as beautiful, it becomes ugly. *As soon as virtue is being known as something good, it becomes evil.* *Therefore being and non-being give birth to each other.* *Difficult and easy accomplish each other.* *Long and short form each other.* *High and low distinguish each other.* *Sound and tone harmonize each other.* *Before and after follow each other as a sequence.* \~ Lao Tzu,Tao Te Ching

We can see a similar pattern in the evolution of the lines if we apply the six stages of growth to the previous model of all the lines in all 64 hexagrams.

## The Waters


Doesn't the final stage of a perfect hexagonal array conflict with the final stage of the chaos at the end of the Universe? Ironically, no. In fact, the honeycomb is a perfect analog or metaphor for the final "death" of the universe.

The apparent conflict arises from misinterpreting what the final stage represents. The perfect hexagonal array and the end state of the universe are not opposites but different scopes of the same fundamental principle: the perfect dissipation of energy. In both contexts, they represent the culmination of creative processes, where energy is distributed so uniformly and efficiently that no further transformation is possible.

Though the hexagonal array appears perfectly ordered, it also represents a state of maximal entropy—where no gradients remain, and thus, no transformation can occur. In the material world, the hexagonal structure (like a honeycomb or crystalline lattice) perfectly dissipates pressure and energy, achieving maximum stability and equilibrium. This formation arises because energy naturally seeks the most efficient, balanced state, which in three dimensions results in hexagonal tessellation. The uniformity and coherence of the hexagon embody perfect structural harmony—no force or energy is left unaccounted for, and all stress is evenly shared among interconnected units.

Interestingly, water itself exemplifies this principle, both in its molecular structure and in its behavior. In its liquid form, water molecules arrange themselves in transient, ever-shifting tetrahedral networks. This dynamic structure allows for the efficient dissipation of energy through the fluid medium, constantly adapting to external forces and redistributing kinetic energy evenly. When water transitions into ice, it forms hexagonal crystalline lattices, such as in snowflakes or ice crystals. These hexagonal patterns are the natural consequence of water's tetrahedral bonding, optimizing structural stability and minimizing energy gradients. This ability to shift between chaotic flow and ordered stability while always seeking energy equilibrium makes water not only the perfect metaphor for the end state of the universe but also a symbolic representation of the cyclical transformation between chaos and order.

On a cosmic scale, the end state of the universe—whether it be heat death, vacuum decay, or the Big Freeze—represents maximum entropy and energy dissipation. Just as the hexagon disperses internal pressure evenly, the final state of existence disperses energy so uniformly that no further change can occur. The universe reaches a state of perfect equilibrium, where all potential for transformation has been exhausted.

Thus, the honeycomb pattern, hexagonal ice crystals, and the ultimate cosmic dissipation are identical in principle but differ in scope and context. The honeycomb and ice both act as material metaphors for the universe's final state because they represent the culmination of dynamic processes into a perfectly stable, energy-dissipative structure. In both cases, creation reaches its ultimate expression by achieving a state of perfect order and balance, whether in the microcosm of a honeycomb, the crystalline lattice of ice, or the macrocosm of the universe itself.

In this way, the final hexagonal state does not oppose chaos but completes it. The cycle closes with a perfect stillness that echoes its chaotic beginning, but in reverse—a mirror of order. Just as water existed before creation in ancient mythologies—calm and undifferentiated—the end state of the universe returns to that primal stillness, the waters of potential within which all new creation will arise.

This concepts is mirrored in the Torah and Bible’s Old Testament in Genesis:

**Genesis 1:1–2 (KJV):**

1. *In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.*
2. *And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.*

Here, we can see that the *waters* existed before God created anything, and, coincidentally, as God was creating the stars, moon, sun, sky earth and all living creatures, God never created water, presumable because it already existed.

We see a similar theme with *the waters* in the Babylonian, Egyptian, Hindu, Greek, Norse, Polynesian, Native American, and  Aztec create stories.

Not surprisingly, the Biblical Hebrew for “Waters” is **מַּיִם** (mayim) can mean many things, such as “primordial chaos”, “life”, “divine sustenance”, “purification”, “divine intention”, “a moving force”.  the phrase “*God moved upon the face of the waters*”  is similar to how we might say in English “*She set the table by the window.*”, which can mean:

- She arranged dishes and cutlery on the table located by the window.
- She placed the entire table near the window.
- She fixed the table near the window (e.g., attached it or made it stable).
- She decided the location for the meeting to be by the window.
- She adjusted the settings on a device (like a smart table) to show a display by the window.

In the Tholonic model, the *primordial waters* is seen as the pre-manifest awareness field, the undifferentiated potential that bifurcates into **Negotiation**, **Definition**, and **Contribution**. Just as awareness itself becomes differentiated through intention, the *waters of the void* are activated by Intention to begin creation.

The final dissipation of energy, like the honeycomb or crystalline ice, represents returning to the *waters*, the latent awareness field from which new creation can arise. This cyclic perspective mirrors how chaos begets order, and order eventually returns to chaos,  both states intrinsically linked to the *waters of potential*.

For this reason, and because of actual studies and research that have been performed, the Tholonic model sees water as the most efficient transmission medium for Tholonic energy.





## Just a Touch of Chaos


The following is a bit of a tangent, but worth sharing before we continue with the lines. Below is a graphic that shows three conditions of the descending pattern of chaos→order. The first condition is *Maximum Freedom*, where the direction of the children is undetermined and completely unlimited. The second condition, *Limited Freedom*, is where the direction of the children is limited by 96% (4% freedom). The final condition, *No Freedom*, is where there can be no deviation from the rule. This is an excellent example of the effect of and necessity for *definition* and *limitation*.


<center><img src='../Images/3stage-freedom.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

The forms used to represent the stages of change are “perfect” archetypes, in that they adhere strictly to a very tight set of rules. In reality, there are many other forces in play other than an isolated set of rules, making it rare, if not impossible, for a perfect archetype to instantiate. In the image above, with just a little bit of chaos, we get forms that are much closer to what we see in the real world. In the images below, we added a little more variation to our perfect process on just two variables, length and angle, resulting in a wider variety of “realistic” forms. The black forms below each variation show the perfect archetype they were based on.

##### Note: The “leaves” of these “plants” were naturally formed by the unfolding of the starboard and port-side arrow heads that indicate the direction of the expanding bifurcations that form the 6 lines of the hexagrams’


<center><img src='../Images/arch-hex-sm.png' style='width:80%'/></center>



## By the Numbers


Let’s run another test to see if the thologram and the I Ching are two views of the same model.

Previously we assigned the positions of the points on the tholon as 1 through 6 in order to work with the positions of the I Ching lines, but while the I Ching order (sequential from top including lines) was 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, the Tholonic order was 0, 5, 1, 3, 2, 4. Here is where the validity of that order is shown.

Now we need to work with the hexagrams and their values, so we need to use the position of the points as the exponential value of 2 (because we’re working in binary), and to do that we need to start counting at 0, not 1. In ***Fig. e1*** (below) you can see the values arrived at for each point, and the exponent used to get that value. ***Fig. e2*** shows the sum of these values for each triad and each side. In ***Fig. e3*** we have added the name and the hexagram. Don’t forget that all these numbers are binary and not the numbers as they appear in the traditional I Ching layout.

<center><img src='../Images/tritest.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

##### <img src='../Images/trialgebra.png' style='float:right;width:20%'/>Note: We identify the lines by grouping together the two points that form that line. This is usually shown with the traditional **overline** symbol (right), however, due to the limitation of the text formatting tools, in written text this will be shown as underlined, for example <u>ND</u> refers to the connecting line, or vector, between N and D).

The values of the lines are determined by the sum of the points that define the lines. For example, the **DC** vector above contains the values 2^1^, 2^3^, 2^2^ or 2, 8, 4 which, when summed, equals 14, which is the value of the line. The value of the triads is similarly determined by adding the values of their defining points. For example, the top triad has the points 2^0^, 2^5^, 2^4^ or 1, 32, 16 which equals 49.

Here are some observations from the above:

-   The sum of any triad and the side opposite that triad always equal 63, the maximum number possible. This was exciting to discover as it supports the Tholonic claim that the effect of any point can be seen on the side opposite that point.  In our example above, we see the side [41䷨~35~ **Decrease**] plus the opposing corner of [*31䷞~28~ **Influence***] equals 35 + 28 = 63.  What this means is that the triad and the opposing vector are the same path name!  This then also tells us that the only 3 paths involved are: *Growth*, *Refinement*, and *Perfection*, with the center path, which is singularity as it has no manifest children, is *Equilibrium*.  More that that, we are being told that Growth itself the stable *N-State*, and it instantiates as the **Limitation** of *Perfection*, and the contribution of *Refinement*, and from these two instances, we create  *Equilibrium*.
-   What is most interesting about this pattern, assuming this is not just an extremely rare and almost impossible coincidence that it perfectly portrays the qualities of growth, is that *Perfection* is presented as the *Limitation*. This is fascinating because perfection itself is perhaps the most limiting concept of all, given that it can never truly be achieved. Yet, the effort to achieve it, represented by *Refinement*, becomes the **Contribution**. In this way, *Growth* emerges not from reaching perfection but from the process of continuous improvement in a vain attempt to reach the impossible, highlighting how the pursuit itself generates the stable state rather than the attainment of an unattainable ideal.
    
-   Every number our example (14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56), including their sums (63, 70), is a multiple of 7 (times 2 to 10), suggesting the the resulting *white dot* = 7
    
-   Every hexagram derived from these Tholonic values has an equal number of Yin and Yang lines (only 10 of the 32 pairs of hexagrams in the I Ching have an equal number of Yin and Yang), telling us these are balanced, stable archetypes.
    
-   Only the value of the top triad is odd when the other triads are even, and even when the other triads are odd.
- If we add all the values together (14+7+21+35) we get decimal value of 77… which is also the octal value of 63!

There are many more patterns and relationships as well, and this is only within one tholon that has no parents or children!



## A Note on Form and Function


Given that every number has a patterned relationship with one or more numbers, we can theoretically reverse engineer where every I Ching hexagram sits within the thologram, assigning a unique binary value to every vector (or point, though here we're focusing on vectors). According to the Tholonic model, this theoretical framework can extend to everything that exists. Here's a concise explanation of that reasoning.

Consider the example of a relatively simple protein composed of 60 amino acids chosen from the standard set of 20 amino acids. While small compared to some proteins containing up to 2,000 amino acids, the probability of forming this particular protein randomly is roughly 1 in 10⁷⁷. Numerically, this probability approaches the number of atoms in the observable universe (around 10⁸⁰), making its spontaneous appearance improbable without constraints.

The key issue with interpreting evolution solely through randomness is that it neglects inherent constraints. Evolutionary theory itself acknowledges selection pressures and environmental limitations, significantly reducing the combinational space. The Tholonic model explicitly incorporates these constraints into its structure.

To illustrate this point, observe the table below:

<center><img src='../Images/realtholons.png' style='width:70%'/></center>
As generations progress, the potential number of combinations rapidly increases. Starting from an initial triad, stable patterns emerge. From each stable pattern, a new triad can form, producing further stable patterns. However, only stable patterns are viable and capable of propagation. After just 129 generations, the theoretical combinations exceed 10⁷⁷. Critically, at each generation, we only generate a manageable set of new parameters, specifically the pair labeled DC.

Thus, the assumption that nature explores the entire combinational space (10⁷⁷ possibilities) is misleading. Tholonically, the available combinational field at each stage is limited to a few properties, embedded self-similarly within each generation. This approach significantly reduces complexity, explaining how new viable patterns can emerge naturally within constrained circumstances.

To clarify this point further, consider a mathematical analogy involving coin flips:

A Bell curve illustrates 50,000 runs of flipping 32 coins:

Test 1: 32 coins → ~16 heads

Test 2: 16 coins (heads from Test 1) → ~8 heads

Test 3: 8 coins → ~4 heads

Test 4: 4 coins → ~2 heads

Test 5: 2 coins → ~1 head

<img src='../Images/101-toincoss.png' style='float:right;width:40%'/>Running these tests sequentially, you inevitably arrive at one coin, representing a 100% chance, given these specific constraints. However, an observer unaware of these constraints might mistakenly assume only a small chance (e.g., 3.2% if initially there were mixed coin types). Without understanding the process and constraints, the observer perceives high improbability where there is, in fact, certainty.

In reality, evolutionary or creative processes do not record failures explicitly; they proceed through stable successes. From the Tholonic perspective, existence inherently proceeds via stable patterns, forward-engineering new possibilities from successful parent states. If a branch fails, it ceases at its last successful stable pattern, with corrections or adaptations naturally emerging, analogous to replacing faulty coins.

Extending this analogy philosophically, one might suggest that each instance carries an implicit binary lineage record. According to the Tholonic model, each tholon inherently encodes a memory of its ancestral path. While the scientific demonstration of such lineage encoding may remain debated (perhaps resonating conceptually with morphic fields), philosophically this claim is reasonable and aligns with the Tholonic perspective that every instance inherently represents its entire history of successful interactions and stable patterns.

<img src="../Images/102-tpaths.png" style='float:right;width:30%'/>This lineage encoding might be envisioned as analogous to the Fourier series concept, wherein hierarchical circular interactions create precise and complex patterns. Each tholon, thus, can conceptually possess a unique "signature" or "fingerprint," representing its exact location and lineage within a broader spectrum of reality.

More deeply, this “signature” doesn’t merely reflect where the tholon is in the structure—it encodes how it came to be. This mirrors the Tholonic principle that Form and Function are not separate, but dual aspects of a single recursive reality. The Form of a tholon is the current stable pattern; its Function is the process that brought it into being. In the Tholonic view, every instance is a self-encoding unit where the path of generation is inherently embedded within the structure of what exists.

Even if empirical demonstration remains complex or contentious, this remains a philosophically coherent perspective within the Tholonic framework.

If we accept this premise then we must also accept that reality itself is, therefore, the repository of all knowledge, awaiting further exploration and decoding. Just as a Fourier series of simple numerical values can reproduce intricate images, reality might inherently encode every instance’s unique lineage within its intrinsic properties, whether through fields, energy patterns, or yet-undiscovered mechanisms.

## Reconstructing the I Ching


If we rebuild the I Ching from the ground up, integrating elements from the I Ching, the Tholonic model, and Western philosophy, we get something like the following:

##### *Note: As mentioned numerous times before, the interpretations, values and relationships shown here are not intended to be conclusive. While I tried to make them as meaningful as possible, they are more used as examples. There are many ways patterns and relationships can be formed and I am sure a better version than the one presented here can be made. If the reader disagrees with some of the conclusions here then consider that an invitation to improve upon it. That is why this book is open-sourced.*


<center><img src='../Images/tholonic-pakua-desc.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

Here are some points about this model:

The 8 trigrams (this is called the *Pa Kua* in the I Ching) are arranged in their binary, or natural order in pairs. The trigrams advance as opposite pairs of 0-7 <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b00.png' style='width:30px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b07.png' style='width:30px'/>, 1-6 <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b01.png' style='width:30px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b06.png' style='width:30px'/>, 2-5 <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b02.png' style='width:30px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b05.png' style='width:30px'/>, and 3-4 <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b03.png' style='width:30px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b04.png' style='width:30px'/> in the clockwise direction. This means the first 4 trigrams are 0, 1, 2, 3, <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b00.png' style='width:30px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b01.png' style='width:30px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b02.png' style='width:30px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b03.png' style='width:30px'/> and the next 4 trigrams are 7, 6, 5, 4 <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b07.png' style='width:30px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b06.png' style='width:30px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b05.png' style='width:30px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b04.png' style='width:30px'/>. This results in a pattern where all opposing numbers always equal 7, the maximum number that can be represented in binary using three places.

**Ring 7**: There are three divisions per quadrant representing the three stages of Tholonic movement (clockwise): **Negotiation**, **Definition**, and **Contribution**. However, it is more accurate to say there are three *phases* or cycles of movement (clockwise), conceptually similar to how three-phase electricity works. All three phases are present all the time at every point, just at different points in the cycle, and, as they are represented in the triads as being 120° apart, they would presumeably appear in the (archetypal) order of the image below. This also suggests that if **Negotiation** starts at the 4:00 position, then **Definition** starts at the 8:00 position and **Contribution** starts at the 12:00 position, putting **Contribution** as the only property that holds a cardinal position, and the most dominant one at that.


<center><img src='../Images/three_phase_waveform.png' style='width:60%'/></center>

**Ring 9**: The two major axes are represented by the four cardinal points. The vertical axis is represented by the most extreme trigrams (7<img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b07.png' style='width:30px'/>, 0<img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b00.png' style='width:30px'/>) for the “north” and the “south,” and the horizontal axis by the most balanced trigrams (5<img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b05.png' style='width:30px'/>, 2<img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b02.png' style='width:30px'/>) for the “east” and “west.”

**Ring 1**: The remaining 4 trigrams (1, 3, 4, 6 in ring 1) are the most imbalanced and are therefore more unstable/dynamic.

The vertical and horizontal axis *reflects*, and the horizontal axis *reflects* as well as *reverses* (like a photo negative). Hence, the lines in the east are a mirror of the lines in the west. This is also true for the lines in the north and the south, but in addition, they are also reversed along the horizontal axis, like a photo negative.

<center><img src='../Images/mirror.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

There are four quadrants, each with three stages, which are defined by the sequential lines (ring 6) of the intermediary trigram (ring 1).

**Ring 5:** Because the first 4 trigrams (<img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b00.png' style='width:30px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b01.png' style='width:30px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b02.png' style='width:30px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b03.png' style='width:30px'/>) all have Yin lines at the top-most position in the trigram we refer to them as ascending because they begin at 0 and ascend towards 7. Likewise, the next 4 trigrams (<img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b07.png' style='width:30px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b06.png' style='width:30px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b05.png' style='width:30px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b04.png' style='width:30px'/>) have Yang lines in their top-most positions, so we call these descending because they start with 7 and descend towards 0.

**Ring 4**: Because the upper hemisphere consists of 4 Yang lines and 2 Yin line (ring 6) and has the cardinal value of 7 (ring 8), it is predominantly Yang in nature. The opposite is true for the lower hemisphere which is predominantly Yin in nature.

## The Origin of Trigrams

We have yet to look closely at how a trigram evolves from nothing. Below is a binary tree that begins with a point of unity that divides itself into two states, 0 and 1. This establishes the most fundamental concept of Yin and Yang. This is then followed by each of those children doing the same by creating their own two children of 0 and 1. We can see that in 2 generations there are now 4 children, each defined by the parent’s fundamental Yin or Yang, and then adding to that the Yin or Yang of the child. These 4 children have the values 0, 2, 1, 3, as shown by the bigrams. This is done one more time to create the final branch of 8 children, each with a value determined by adding their Yin or Yang value to the bigrams passed down by the parents. Now we have 8 trigrams: 0, 4, 2, 3, 6, 1, 5, 3, 7. Unfortunately, this order seems to lack any symmetry or pattern that is compatible with our model, suggesting our model is incorrect.


<center><img src='../Images/btree-top.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

However, if we flip the tree upside down, like a mirror image, the order immediately appears! This is important when we are adding lines, because if we start with <img src='../Images/bc/bigram00.png' style='width:30px'/> and add a <img src='../Images/bc/yang.png' style='width:30px'/>, you might expect we get a <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b04.png' style='width:30px'/>, but as we will need to flip it to maintain the “mirrored” order, we will actually get a <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b01.png' style='width:30px'/>. Now we can see the first order of  {0,1}, the 2<sup>nd</sup> order of {0,1,2,3}, and the final and 3<sup>rd</sup> order of {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7}. Of course, we could also achieve this order if we only added new lines *below* the previous lines (which would also mean we need to write from left to right if we were using numbers instead of lines), but that would defeat the point of discovering this fascinating pattern where a top-down order naturally puts all the odd numbers on the right and all the even numbers on the left, but when we flip to bottom-up, the numbers change to their sequential order.


<center><img src='../Images/btree-bottom.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

Now that we have our model in order, we can see if our trigrams fit into it in any way that makes sense. We do this simply by assigning the names of the trigrams that have the same values, while also assigning the first two branches of 0 and 1 to be that of the two branches of the Tholonic trigram, like this:


<center><img src='../Images/attr-btree.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

We may run into a problem of semantics and context using the words **Definition** and **Contribution** in this binary framework. The words Yin and Yang seem to fit much better, but it is difficult to say **Definition** is Yin and **Contribution** is Yang, as both can be both depending on the context. For now, we will say **Definition** is Yin as it aligns with the 0 side of the first 0/1 duality, and represents the absence of value but defines the ‘space’ for it, and **Contribution** is Yang as it aligns with the 1 side, as it represents the contribution of value within  that space.

We can see that every bigram creates two trigram children, and this pair of trigrams is always made up of one cardinal element and one dynamic element. This suggests that the parent is both a *state* (cardinal/stable) and an *energy* (dynamic/unstable) combined. This mirrors two properties that created the zero-dimensional point, where the *state* is the *awareness* of the concept of a point, and the *energy* is the *intention* to conceive it.

Both of these qualities exist in the bigram but can only find separation in the (trigram) children. We can also see that the nature of the energy is compatible with the nature of the state. Here we have a bit of a challenge because we do not have good words that describe these states and their movement, similar to the way “balance” is a state and a movement. Computer programming languages do have such a concept. It is called a “class,” and a class contains both static information and the dynamic code that can act on that information. We will have to make do with some borrowed and creative nouns and verbs.

***Absorb*** is a good word to describe the parent that results from the combined state of *Earth* and the energy of *Filling*. This parent must express a quality common to both elements. Absorption is the process by which something is *filled*, and *Earth*, being the pure Yin of 0, can do nothing but absorb and be filled. Other readers may find different terms that suit them better, and the words offered here are simply suggestions.

***Contract*** is used to describe the nature of *Water*, because water, which always travels the path of least resistance, will always pool, *Collecting* at the lowest point. Of course, all energy travels the path of least resistance, but *Water* is meant to describe that property.

***Consume*** describes the nature of *Fire*, as it consumes, or uses up or *empties* its fuel. This is almost the textbook definition of *Emptying*.

***Expand*** describes the nature of *Air*, as it will expand to define the “space” of reality. *Air* here does not simply mean the air we breathe, but refers more to the space that exists between all things, be they atoms or planets. If one considered the expanding universe as a function of *Air*, which was itself a function of the Big Bang, the verb of *Release* fits nicely. From this perspective, *Air* might also be the element of dark matter.


<center><img src='../Images/bigrams-ele.png' style='width:20%'/></center>

Here is an alternative way of looking at this model. Notice how all the horizontal pairs of pink dots equal 7, and all the pairs of orange dots equal 3, and how descriptions are opposite in nature for every pair.


<center><img src='../Images/btree-circ.png' style='width:60%'/></center>

With the introduction of bigrams, let’s look at the order of the trigrams again.


<center><img src='../Images/8-fold-1.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

The chart below shows the two dimensions of the bigram as described by their children. The cardinal elements are across the top, and the dynamic properties down the side. Using what we know about the trigrams, we can deduce the nature of the bigrams.


<center><img src='../Images/elementsgrid.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

Like the 32 paths of the 64 hexagrams, we also have 4 paths of the 8 trigrams.  Here is a brief overview:

Path 1: [1**☰**~7~ Initiation] ⬄ [*8**☷**~0~ Acceptance*] ⇨ **Creation** *(Action unified with receptivity)*
Path 2: [5**☴**~6~ Subtlety] ⬄ [*4**☳**~1~ Impulse*] ⇨ **Adaptation** *(Responsive interaction)*
Path 3: [3**☲**~5~ Clarity] ⬄ [*6**☵**~2~ Depth*] ⇨ **Insight** *(Perception unified understanding)*
Path 4: [7**☶**~4~ Stability] ⬄ [*2**☱**~3~ Joy*] ⇨ **Sustainability** *(Dynamic vitality, i.e., joy and inspiration, with structural endurance)*

While there may be many ways to create an order of the trigrams, the Tholonic model’s order continually re-validates itself every time we look at it from a different perspective. How, then, do these trigrams relate to a tholon? If we mapped the binary values to the tholon, the relationship is obvious and powerful, as shown in the graphic below.  This is the same map we showed previously, but here we are also looking at the trigrams, which show an entirely different dimension.



<center><img src='../Images/tri-paths-4.png' style='width:80%'/></center>

Here are some of the points spelled out:

**Orientation**

The arrangement of the trigrams are reversed between the value in a triad and the value on the opposing edge, suggesting that form and function are composed of the same properties, but in opposing contexts.  

In the hexagram-based paths map, The four elements align with the concept of *Perfection*, *Growth* is aligned with  *Collecting* and *Emptying*, and  *Refinement* is aligned with *Filling* and *Releasing*, which are conceptuality similar to the trigrams of *Growth*, suggesting that *Refinement* is the foundational to *Growth*.  In the trigram-basaed path map:

- *Perfection* is composed of *Insight*.
- *Growth* is composed of *Adaptation*.
- *Refinement* is composed of *Sustainability*.

**Symbolism**

The same two I Ching trigrams of 1 <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b01.png' style='width:30px'/> *Filling* and 6 <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b06.png' style='width:30px'/> *Release* exist in both the top triad and the opposing bottom <u>DC</u> edge. In the top triad they exist as the lower and upped trigram, respectively, to create *descending* side of the *Growth* path as hexagram [42䷩~49~ **Increase**], wherein it states:

> - *Sacrifice on the part of those above for the increase of those below*

Across the bottom <u>CD</u> edge, their position in swapped to create the *ascending* side of the *Growth* hexagram [*32䷟~14~ **Duration***], wherein it states:

> - *Duration is rather the self-contained and therefore self-renewing movement of an organized, firmly integrated whole, taking place in accordance with immutable laws and beginning anew at every ending.*
>
> **Example Tholons and Partons**
>
> The above diagram is a good example of tholons and partons. 
>
> We can see swapping the values of a triad with those of the opposing edge yields the values of the corresponding virtual tholon. This operation also inverts all the hexagrams to their opposites within the path to which each hexagram belongs.
>
> This is important because it shows how two trigrams can represent the internal functions (i.e. Increase) as a triad, and its interfacing edge, effectively acting as the *form*, of the the opposing vector.
>
> Thus, the primal tholon of a single line has two possible states, Yin or Yang. Three lines form a trigram tholon with eight states. Two trigrams combine to form a hexagram tholon with 64 states. Of thos 64 states, seven hexagrams explicitly form one 'real' tholon, which, along with its complementary 'virtual' state, forms a complete Tholonic structure.  This is a total of 14 partons and 19 tholons across 5 levels of self-similar expression to create one complete tholon.  that’s a lot of moving parts!
>
> **Perfect Coordination**

It would be difficult to argue that the symbolism of the I Ching and the and structural relationships if the tholons revealed here are merely pareidolic. 

While the traditional King Wen often perfectly represent the Tholonic symbolism, there a some interpretations that miss the mark, but this inaccuracy is easily understood given the bias or world view of the original interpretations and assigned meanings that date back thousands of years.  For example, in the hexagram [*63䷾ ~21~ **After Completion***], it states:

- *“Hence the present hexagram indicates the conditions of a time of climax, which necessitate the utmost caution.*
- *Thus the superior man takes thought of misfortune and arms himself against it in advance.”*

The sentiment here is that once something is perfect, only decay can follow, and one must prepare oneself for the ensuing problems. While this may be true, it does not capture the larger sentiment that once something has reached perfection or has been completed, its cycle of change has ended. More importantly, this completed cycle has contributed to the greater whole, changing it in the process. Rather than arming oneself and preparing for misfortune, the Tholonic position is to appreciate the creation, offer it up to the world, let it go, and move on in the same way an artist lays down his brush after he has finished his painting.  

This is the same sentiment behind the Buddhist sand mandala’s where monks, with great mindfulness and precision,  carefully place millions of grains of colored sand into an beautiful and elaborate mandala design, only to destroy it when it is finished as an act of non-attachment.  In this scenario, the act of destruction of the purpose of the creation, so the I Ching’s interpretations is not accurate or even relevant to the monk.  Fortunately, it is fairly easy to see past the world view to the larger Universal truth being stated.

Here is a more complete example showing how the I Ching reflects the Tholonic symbolism.

The **Definition** triad correlates  to the path of *descending* PERFECTION, formed by [64䷿ ~42~ **Before Completion**] as $\frac{Fire}{Water}$.The *function* of this triad symbolizes the striving towards perfection, emphasizing the *limitation* required to define and complete a state.

- *“Thus the superior man is careful in the differentiation of things, so that each finds its place.”*

It’s inverse on the **<u>CN</u>** edge  that returns **Contribution** to the parent is represented as [*63䷾ ~21~ **After Completion***] as $\frac{Water}{Fire}$ is the outer *form* or expression of its associated  *function*.

- *“[This] hexagram indicates the conditions of a time of climax”*

The **Contribution** triad correlates to the *ascending* path of REFINEMENT, shown through [*31䷞ ~28~ **Influence***] formed by $\frac{Collecting}{Emptying}$.  The function of this triad symbolizes the *mutual and harmonious integration between forces*.

- *“Thus the superior man encourages people to approach him by his readiness to receive them.”*

It’s inverse on the **<u>ND</u>** edge that begins a new definition is represented as [41䷨ ~35~ **Decrease**] formed by $\frac{Emptying}{Collecting}$ is the outer form of expression the instantiation of a new form.

- *“The lake at the foot of the mountain evaporates. In this way it decreases to the benefit of the mountain, which is enriched by its moisture.”*

In the center, a new tholon appears along the axis of *Growth*.  This triad has no opposing side, or rather, both sides have yet to be expressed.  This child tholon holds both hexagram [12䷋ ~56~ **Standstill**] formed by $\frac{Air}{Earth}$, and its function is clearly symbolized by the challenges one faces in the manifest world.

- *“Heaven is above, drawing farther and farther away, while the earth below sinks farther into the depths.”*

It’s opposing hexagram is that of [*11䷊ ~7~ **Peace***] formed by $\frac{Earth}{Air}$, and which is symbolizes by joining of heaven and earth.

- *“The Receptive, which moves downward, stands above; the Creative, which moves upward, is below. Hence their influences meet and are in harmony, so that all living things bloom and prosper.”*

Yet, neither of these functions has a form, or rather the form *is* it’s function and it’s function *is* its form. In other words, what something does determines what something is.  That is why this triad is correlated to the path of “Passage”, because this the the “way” of creation. By changing what something does, you change what it is, and by changing what it is, you change what it does. What something is, and what it does, is what determines if it exists on a path of disintegration and stagnation, or on the path of peace and harmony.

We can also see how *Equilibrium* interacts with the manifest world where the central triad touches all three outer edges of Refinement, Perfection and Growth, and bridges every neighboring triad. This *Equilibrium* triad, by both its symbolism and spatial position, serves as a fitting base of the tetrahedron, at least in the context of the Thologram, anchoring the system in the interaction between the abstract (air, heaven, Yang, <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b07.png' style='width:30px'/>) and the material (earth, Yin, <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b00.png' style='width:30px'/>).

On the cosmic scale, we can see a good example of an instance of this central triad in the Laniakea Supercluster, the largest known structure in the observable Universe.

Comparing the central triad to the Laniakea Supercluster might seem unusual, but it’s surprisingly fitting. At the heart of the Laniakea Supercluster lies the *Great Attractor*, a gravitational focal point pulling approximately 100,000 galaxies, including our Milky Way, across a region about 500 million light-years wide. Importantly, this gravitational attraction is not due to a massive black hole; rather, it emerges from the collective mass of the supercluster itself, making its center more of a place than a object, i.e., a function rather than a form.

Similarly, the central triad’s structure emerges naturally from functional interactions of balance, definition, and equilibrium, much like the gravitational dynamics defining Laniakea. Each structure inherently embodies its purpose: the supercluster integrates galaxies gravitationally to maintain cosmic balance and movement, while the central triad integrates hexagrams symbolically to achieve conceptual harmony. Both illustrate the Tholonic principles clearly: definition creates boundaries and identities; contribution fosters dynamic interactions; and negotiation harmonizes these processes into sustainable patterns. Despite their vast difference in scale, one cosmic, the other conceptual, both demonstrate the inseparable and mutually reinforcing relationship between form and function.

**Cosmic Metaphore**

Coincidentally, our journey to Laniakea provides an apt metaphor for the Tholon, illustrating its essential triad of equilibrium, holding together all other triads—perfection, growth, and refinement. Just as we find ourselves gravitationally drawn toward Laniakea, we are similarly drawn toward perfection, the ultimate limitation, which remains ever elusive as the universe expands, continually placing it beyond reach. Yet, precisely because we already exist within the gravitational embrace of Laniakea, this expansive drift is moderated, creating conditions in which our journey remains perpetually possible. This gravitational moderation represents the Tholon's equilibrium, the balanced negotiation of forces that binds together and sustains the dynamic interactions of perfection (as limitation), growth, and refinement (as integration). Thus, our journey within the supercluster mirrors the recursive sustainability of the Tholon itself, which endures and evolves as long as it maintains its integrated wholeness.

In explicitly Tholonic terms, the metaphor of our journey to Laniakea encapsulates the principle of **Negotiation**-**Definition**-**Contribution** (*NDC*). *Perfection* is the ultimate **Definition**/**Limitation**, a destination that defines the boundary and structure of our striving yet remains inherently unattainable. The expanding universe symbolizes the constant negotiation of forces—an equilibrium state where gravitational pull and expansive force are continually balanced, preventing collapse into perfection or dissolution into chaos. Our ongoing journey toward Laniakea symbolizes **Contribution** (**Integration**), illustrating how we continuously integrate our experiences, insights, and growth into the greater structure. The gravitational moderation, ensuring that the journey remains eternally achievable yet never completed, embodies the Tholonic state of stable negotiation, maintaining a recursive and sustainable balance between the **Definition** of perfection and the **Contribution** of perpetual refinement and growth.

**Perfect Integration**

The two paths that create this <u>CN</u> vector are also non-coincidentally matched:

*Descending* GROWTH: [42䷩*~49~* **Increase**], [*32䷟~14~ **Duration***] “*Sacrifice on the part of those above for the increase of those below.*”

*Ascending* REFINEMENT: [*31䷞~28~ **Influence***], [41䷨*~35~* **Decrease**] “*… their powers attract each other so that they unite*.”

<img src='../Images/32pairs.png' style='float:right; width:50%'/>The Tholonic interpretation of the I Ching reveals a clear structural relationship among *Growth*, *Perfection*, and *Refinement*, collectively forming the **????** "Passage," which embodies the path of *Equilibrium*.

When these paths are highlighted within the full sequence of paths, a compelling pattern emerges: each highlighted path is separated precisely by six paths. The path of *Equilibrium* appears immediately following the first six paths, succeeding the two foundational pairs, *Primordial Duality* and *Cycle of Influence*, that mark the beginning and end of the sequence.

Uniquely, *Equilibrium* stands apart as a Cardinal Path, distinguished from the other three. This arrangement not only ensures a perfectly even distribution of Tholonic attributes throughout the 64 hexagrams, reinforcing the internal symmetry and balance of the model, but also underscores the alignment and significance of these four paths within both the I Ching and the Tholonic framework.

## Binary Tholons  (doesn’t work?)

We have 6 lines in the hexagram and 6 vectors in a tetrahedron. If the Tholonic claim is that we should see similar patterns in both, then creating a tetrahedron from the lines should highlight these patterns.

In the image below (left), the Yang lines are cyan, and the Yin lines are magenta. The Yin/Yang sequence is that of the "perfect" hexagram, [*63䷾ ~21~ **After Completion***], and we do indeed see the same symmetry in the Tholon map (right), although rotated by 120°. This rotation appears to place **Definition**/**Limitation** at the top of the triad, but this perspective can be misleading, as there is no absolute "top" or "bottom." Such concepts are purely relative. What we can say definitively is that the Yang branch expands outward from **Definition**/**Limitation**, while the Yin branch completes or defines it. Although **Definition**/**Limitation** is inherently a Yin attribute, the outward Yang action requires this limitation for creation to form. This logic is perfectly mirrored in the right image, where ascending hexagrams (green) move from maximum Yin toward Yang, and descending hexagrams (red) move from maximum Yang back toward Yin.

<center><img src='../Images/line-tetra-compare.png' style='width:70%'/></center>

<img src='../Images/pyramid-bottom.png' style='float:right;width:20%'/>When viewed as a tetrahedron, we can see all the Yang lines at the base, creating a solid foundation. However, it is not the intuitive central triangle that serves as the base, but rather the top triad. This may seem counterintuitive at first, but it makes sense when we realize that the top triad is always identical to its parent—meaning it mirrors the original primal triad in every generation. In that sense, it serves as the true foundation of all tholons, making the base triad of every tholon identical to the first act of creation.

This contrast in orientation and perspective between the I Ching and Tholonic models is not contradictory, rather, it reflects a shift in viewpoint, much like the now-famous “Revolution Giraffes” sculpture, which reveals either giraffes or elephants depending on the angle of observation:

<center><img src='../Images/016-eleph-giraf.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

## Hexagrams

With the hexagrams in their binary order, we can put together the 64 hexagrams (below). Some of the hexagrams are identified as being made of trigrams that are: <img src='../Images/trigram_colors.png' style='width:25%'/>.  These attributes derived from the fundamental and basic I Ching.

***The Scope hexagrams:*** There are 2 (4 hexagrams)  pairs of *scope* hexagrams that are composed of only the primary (vertical/solstice) major cardinal  trigrams of *Air* <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b07.png' style='width:30px'/>~7~ and *Earth* <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b00.png' style='width:30px'/>~0~. These two trigrams define the *maximum* and *minimum*, or *north*/*Air* and *south/Earth* in the Tholonic *Pakua*, as shown previously. These hexagrams on the path of *The Primordial Duality*<img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB63.png' style='width:30px'/><img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB00.png' style='width:30px'/>and *Equilibrium* <img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB56.png' style='width:30px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB07.png' style='width:30px'/>. These tri/hexagrams are the *Negotiating* in nature.

***The Context hexagrams:*** There are 2 pairs (4 hexagrams) of *context* hexagrams that are compose of only the secondary (horizontal/equinox) major cardinal trigrams of *Fire* <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b02.png' style='width:30px'/>~2~ and *Water* <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b05.png' style='width:30px'/>~5~. These two trigrams define the area or *movement* within the *scope*.  In the Tholonic *Pakua* they are *west/Water* and *east/Fire*.  These hexagrams are on the path of *Guidance* <img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB45.png' style='width:30px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB18.png' style='width:30px'/> and  *Perfection* <img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB42.png' style='width:30px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB21.png' style='width:30px'/>.  These tri/hexagrams are *Defining*/*Limiting* in nature.

***The Transitional hexagrams:*** There are 8 pairs (16 hexagrams) of *transitional* hexagrams formed by *Filling* <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b01.png' style='width:30px'/>~1~, *Releasing* <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b06.png' style='width:30px'/>~6~ and *Collecting* <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b03.png' style='width:30px'/>~3~,  *Emptying* <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b04.png' style='width:30px'/>~4~.  These tri/hexagrams are *Contributing/Integrating* in nature.

In the Tholonic Pakua, these minor cardinal trigrams transition between the major cardinal trigrams.

These three types of hexagrams account for 12 pairs, or 24 hexagrams that are derived from cardinal trigrams. The remaining 20 pairs, or 40 hexagrams, are a mixture of dissimilar trigrams that describe movement relative to these cardinal-class points.

<center><img src='../Images/64hexagrams-4.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

<img src='../Images/dot-pattern.png' style='float:right;width:30%'/>You can see the very self-similar pattern that emerges. Each quadrant above contains 16 hexagrams, but if we were to map these to the four sides of a tetrahedron, we would need exactly 15 hexagrams for a side. This can be easily accomplished if we isolate the four cardinal hexagrams as coordinate markers that define the limits. This is shown in the charts below where hexagrams 2<img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB00.png' style='width:20px'/>*~0~* and 1<img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB63.png' style='width:20px'/>*~63~* define the vertical min/max. These two hexagrams represent the points within which all the other hexagrams come into being. 

On a fascinating related note, in the images below, we have mapped the distribution of the *cumulative* Yin and Yang across matrices of increasing complexity, composed of upper and lower values. In the “2 bit” example, we begin with a simple 2-bit matrix containing the binary combinations 00, 01, 10, and 11. We then count how many of these combinations have zero 1s, how many have one 1s, and how many have two 1s, which in this case is as follows:

- Numbers with 0 ones: 1
- Numbers with 1 one:  2
- Numbers with 2 ones: 1
- 

<img src='../Images/0101.png' style='float:right;width:15%'/>The next number, 3 in this case, inherits the Yin/Yang map from 2 simply because the 2x2 is inevitably a part of the 3x3 grid. In this way every value represents a history of every value leading up to it. We then visualize these distributions on a 2x2 matrix, assigning the horizontal axis (x-values) as 0 and 1, and the vertical axis (y-values) also as 0 and 1. In these visualizations, the '1's, or Yang values, are represented by shades of red, while the '0's, or Yin values, are depicted in shades of blue. Together, these colors form a gradient spectrum, capturing all ranges between maximum Yin and maximum Yang.

The purpose of this visualization is to illustrate the dynamic interplay between emerging Yin (0) and emerging Yang (1). By mapping these interactions across matrices of increasing complexity, we reveal the intricate patterns that arise as numerical representations become progressively more complex. This process sheds light on the fundamental nature of binary interactions, reflecting deeper universal patterns found in the structure of reality itself.

<img src='../Images/grid-1.png' style='width:100%'/>

<img src='../Images/yinyangratios.png' style='float:right;width:50%'/>What we see is a self-similar pattern that first appears clearly in the 8-bit array, which shows 64 cells, with increasing resolution as we expand the range of numbers we are examining. By around 32 bits, we obtain a distinct image of a pattern that will persist regardless of how large the number becomes. As the numbers increase, the grid effectively "zooms out," revealing the next iteration of the same recurring pattern. Even when we reach the enormous value of approximately $1.23 \times 10^{903}$, the pattern remains consistent and clearly recognizable.  What is not immediately obvious is that the only numbers that are evenly Yin and Yang are numbers that are powers of 2, and the next number after that drops precipitously, and continues to drop before making its way back to a  balanced state.  Surprisingly, the number with the most Yin and least Yang of all numbers that exist, is the number 9, with a ~2/3 Yang/Yin ratio

OK, that was a (hopefully) interesting distraction, so let’s get back to the subject of rebuilding the I Ching.

We now have 62 hexagrams that we need to put into 60 places, but another problem exists as well: when we fill each triad with hexagrams, the sum of the hexagrams in the three corners has to equal 63. Without this consistency, the three outer triads will not be able to create the 4^th^ inner triad, which must follow the same pattern in order to maintain consistency and interconnectedness across all triads.  It turns out that the solution to one problem automatically solves the other problem.


<center><img src='../Images/tetrahex.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

The obvious two children of the primal coordinate pair hexagrams are [*11<img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB07.png' style='width:20px'/>~7~ **Peace***] and [12<img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB56.png' style='width:20px'/>*~56~* **Standstill**], and we can confirm this because of all the 31 remaining possible pairs that together equal their parents, this is the only cardinal pair. In addition, these 4 hexagrams are the only hexagrams that are created by the two defining trigrams of <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b07.png' style='width:30px'/> and <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b00.png' style='width:30px'/>. Now, all major coordinate hexagrams are *defining* points that the remaining 60 hexagrams exist within.

These children quite naturally fit into the larger triads pattern with [12<img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB56.png' style='width:20px'/>*~56~* **Standstill**] as the *N*-state of the triad of *Limitation* (right triad) and [*11<img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB07.png' style='width:20px'/>~7~ **Peace***] as the *N*-state of the triad of **Contribution** (left triad).

At first glance, this arrangement looks very promising, as the primary cardinal (blue-framed) hexagrams occupy cardinal positions, and the sum of their binary values equals a multiple of 63. Initially, the patterns formed by the green and red cardinal hexagrams don't appear meaningful. However, upon combining the three outer trigrams, the green and red hexagrams form a complete triad. This result, by itself, is not particularly special, as any unique, symmetrical pattern would ensure that all dots are ultimately filled. The same logic applies to each quadrant containing four green dots and one red dot.

Nevertheless, this arrangement reveals a unique and significant aspect: the cardinal point of the [*2䷁~0~ **Receptive***] hexagram is positioned on a triad that is both opposite to the top triad and fundamentally incompatible with the other three triads. Remarkably, it defines the critical intersection where all three triads converge, yet it does not itself appear explicitly among the combined triads. This unusual configuration allows for the manifestation of the other three cardinal points, precisely due to the absence of this crucial cardinal point, representing zero (0), pure Yin, and the emptiness underlying duality itself.

Additionally, we observe that the left and right triads are symmetrical variations of the top triad, each rotated around the vertical (Z) axis. In contrast, the central triad is distinctively flipped around the horizontal (X) axis, rather than rotated around the Z-axis. This distinction introduces a genuine third dimension into the structure, significantly enhancing its complexity and depth.

It's also noteworthy that the triad formed by the red dots within the combined triads suggests a spiral element. Moreover, the smaller inner triangle formed by these points occupies exactly $\frac{7}{16}$ of the area of the outer triangle. This ratio is particularly intriguing because it is yet another instance of the numbers 7 and 16 appearing prominently, this time, together in a single relationship.

<center><img src='../Images/3tridots.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

There are several other validating patterns emerged that were pretty astounding.


<center><img src='../Images/tetrahex-hex-triplet-3.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

A truly astonishing pattern emerges when we add the totals of the green hexagrams (context, **Defining/Limiting**) for each triad:  the left and right triads are 7-based, and the center triad are 6 based, and this holds true for the red (transitional, **Contribution/Integration**) values as well.  We also see the right traid’s  red value is double the left triad’s red value, and the all the red values times 4 equal the green’s total value.



<center><img src='../Images/tri-calcs.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

Of course, all these relationships are easily explained with math and geometry, but to see them so well integrated, or perhaps even fundamental, to an ancient Taoist philosophic treatise and how they validate the symbolism of I Ching and the Tholonic model is exciting to discover.

***Things to notice***

Every value within this system can be expressed using formulas derived solely from the first four prime numbers, or the values themselves are prime numbers. Notably, the sum of all values in the central Tholonic trigram equals 216, or 6×6×6, and intriguingly, 216 divided by 63 equals exactly $\frac{24}{7}$ (approximately 3.42857). While it may be tempting to dismiss this as a mere coincidence, it is worth considering that the ancient Egyptians and Babylonians, who employed base-60 and base-12 numerical systems, might have similarly adopted numeric frameworks based on symbolic or mathematical reasoning, especially in light of the fact that these cultures were highly symbolic. The commonly accepted historical explanation attributes their use of the 24-hour day and the 7-day week primarily to astronomical observations of celestial cycles. However, there is no explicit historical evidence conclusively proving that observational astronomy alone dictated these numeric divisions. Therefore, it remains plausible, and indeed reasonable, that these cultures originally established numeric divisions based on inherent symbolic or mathematical structures, which were subsequently integrated into their astronomical and observational frameworks.

Notice how each of the four child triads in ***Fig. h3a***, and by implication, ***Fig. h3***, have values (36, 27, 21, 42), which are also the natural pairs of {36, 27}, *Dignity* (green framed) and 21, 42, *Perfection* (red framed, cardinal). Notice also how the pair of *Dignity* is on the vertical axis and the pair of *Perfection* is on the horizontal axis.

[52<img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB36.png' style='width:20px'/>~36~ **Keeping Still**] and [*58*<img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB27.png' style='width:20px'/>*~27~* ***Joyous***] (transitional, *Dynamic Equilibrium*)

[*63*<img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB21.png' style='width:20px'/>*~21~*  ***After Completion***] and [64<img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB42.png' style='width:20px'/>~42~ **Before Completion**] (balanced, *Perfection*)

This is a quite remarkable association, as it perfectly describes the archetypes of duality of movement and balance as the two axes within which the hexagrams exist. It also tells us that the movement precedes balance, as the values between the first duality of [*2*<img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB00.png' style='width:20px'/>*~0~*] and [1<img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB63.png' style='width:20px'/>~63~] are those of *Dynamic Equilibrium* and the created children, that between [*11*<img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB07.png' style='width:20px'/>*~7~*] and [12<img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB56.png' style='width:20px'/>~56~] creates the balance needed in the *Completion Cycle*.  This claim is fully supported by Newtons Second Law of Motion, *F=ma*, which clearly demonstrates that equilibrium or balance occurs only when acceleration (movement) becomes zero. Therefore, movement is a necessary precursor to achieving balance.

The vertical values always sum to 63 and the horizontal values always sum to 63, making it very clear that there are two axis formed by the primary and secondary cardinal values.

The patterns in this Tholonic layout of the I Ching strongly confirm the compatibility of these two models.

Using the above framework, we can create a sequence of the I Ching based on the Tholonic model above:


<center><img src='../Images/t-sequence.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

***Things to Notice***

Because the four cardinal points define the framework and do not make up the dynamic part of the circle, there are exactly 60 points on the circle.

Again, this perspective aligns closely with the ancient Babylonian approach to time measurement, specifically their introduction of the 60-second minute and the 60-minute hour. Modern explanations often suggest that the Babylonians adopted 360 degrees because it approximated their estimate of the days in a year. However, this oversimplified interpretation overlooks the sophistication of ancient Babylonian society, renowned for its precision in navigation, architecture, agriculture, astronomy, and governance. It seems implausible that they would have failed to accurately count the number of days in a year or simply ignored extra days. A more convincing explanation is that the Babylonians chose the number 60 due to its mathematical elegance and foundational role in nature, as 60 is a highly composite number, the product of the first three prime numbers: 2²×3×5. Moreover, 2²×3 equals 12, which directly corresponds to the widely adopted division of the day into two sets of 12 hours, a system independently utilized by ancient Egyptian and Chinese cultures. This numerical harmony suggests that the selection of these numbers was based on deeper mathematical reasoning rather than mere observational convenience.

- Here is what you can do with 2, 3, and 5
- $2 × 3 × 5$ = 6 × 5 = **30**
- $2^2 × 3 × 5$ = 4 × 3 × 5 = **60**
- $2 × 3^2 × 5$ = 2 × 9 × 5 = **90**
- $2^3 × 3 × 5$ = 8 × 3 × 5 = **120**
- $2^2 × 3^2 × 5$ = 4 × 9 × 5 = **180**
- $2 × 3^3 × 5$ = 2 × 27 × 5 = **270**
- $2^3 × 3^2 × 5$ = 8 × 9 × 5 = **360**

While the numbers are not sequential, each pair of opposites equals 63. I have added the octal (base 8) value because it is far more clear. Base-8, if you are not familiar with octals, it is simply a number system that is based on the eight values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. This means when you are counting and you get to 8, you have to start with the double digits, so our base-10 number 8 in octal is written as “10”.


<center><img src='../Images/decoct.png' style='width:70%'/></center>

The beauty of using octal numbers for the I Ching is the number itself is telling you what trigrams it’s made of. For example, hexagram [*62䷽**~12~***]  as a binary value of 12 (001100), which, in octal, is ***o***14 (we use ‘***o***’ for octal numbers, and ***‘b’*** for binary). Hexagram [*62䷽**~12~***] is composed of two trigrams: 001 and 100. We convert from binary to octal: ***b***001 = ***o***1, and ***b***100 = ***o***4. Then we simply put the two numbers next to each other to get ***o***14. This ability to add numbers just by putting them together only works when converting binary base<sub>2</sub>, octal base<sub>8</sub>, hexadecimal base<sub>16</sub>, base<sub>32</sub>, or any base that is a power of 2. Perhaps that is why some ancient Native American and Proto-Indo-European cultures (allegedly) chose to use the octal system.

Numbers are not as intuitive as images, so here are a couple of charts based on the above sequence that clearly show the self-similarity triad pattern of the sequence

The graph on the left (below) plots each of the quadrants in the sequence above by the position in the sequence. Each quadrant has 15 positions (the Y axis), and there are 64 hexagrams (the X axis). The self-similar pattern of a larger triad whose two sides are made of smaller triads becomes quite clear. The middle plot shows the outline of that same plot, showing an extended or virtual self-similar pattern in light gray, which is better shown in the rightmost plot.

These plots show how the I Ching almost reconstructs the Thologram from scratch.

## Cross-Models: Astrology and the I Ching

This section demonstrates how the I Ching and the Thologram align with other rational systems. Some may question the rationality of astrology, yet it undeniably possesses philosophical and symbolic rationality. While astrology might not fully conform to modern scientific criteria, it undeniably has roots in scientific observation and reasoning. If it did not, astronomy could not have evolved from astrology during the Scientific Revolution of the 16th and 17th centuries. Given that the primary objective of the Tholonic model is to unify scientific, symbolic, and philosophical perspectives, astrology clearly warrants serious investigation and consideration.

The fundamental structure that the I Ching and related Eastern thinking is built on is essentially the same as the model for astrology and related Western thinking. This is not at all surprising, as both cultures were observing the same laws and patterns in action. However, if we find where they combine and overlap, we can understand one model that encompasses both.

In astrology, each sign is assigned an element property of *Fire*, *Earth*, *Air*, or *Water*, and a characteristic of Cardinal, Fixed, or Mutable. This makes twelve signs. We can easily see how the 6 lines of the I Ching/thologram would fit neatly into twelve, but if we want to understand the why's and how's, we have to go deeper. The first requirement for association is not only that the six lines have to map to twelve signs, but the twelve signs need to be mapped to a *complete* tholon, which is a tholon map and its virtual double.

We start by assigning the most fundamental concepts of the I Ching, which are 1 <img src='../Images/bc/yang.png' style='width:35px'/> and 0 <img src='../Images/bc/yin.png' style='width:35px'/> and their virtual counterparts, to the most fundamental signs of astrology, which are the cardinal signs in the following manner:

**Cardinals**

The spectrum between **Definition** and **Contribution** is the Tholonic polarity that creation exists within. Aires, the first fire sign and only cardinal fire sign, is mapped to **Contribution**. Fire is the definition of contribution as it gives at a cost to itself. Fire is the contribution of light and heat at the sacrifice of that which keeps it alive. Capricorn, a cardinal earth sign, is ruled by the Great Limiter itself, Saturn, so there is no question that it fits in the space of **Definition** quite nicely. Aires and Capricorn are not opposite to each other, but they are the most dissimilar to each other and are perpendicular to each other. They represent two different dimensions. 

The virtual counterpart to Aires, or the reflection of Aires' energy, is Libra, the sign of equilibrium and balance. This is poetically satisfying as the act of fire is the process of a transformation that ends in balance. In the astrological framework, this is the spectrum or axis of ***I Am↔I Balance***. The virtual counterpart of Capricorn is the nurturing and protective Cancer, which creates the ***I Use↔I Feel*** axis.

**Fixed and Mutable**

Leo, like the sun that rules it, is the instantiation of fire, and like all instances, it is limited by its context: think sun vs. campfire. Its virtual counterpart is the world-changing, innovative Aquarius. This is the ***I Will↔I Know*** spectrum.

Taurus consuming nature’s counterpart is the penetrating Scorpio. This is the ***I Have ↔ I Desire*** spectrum.

The counterpart to the wise Sagittarius is the witty Gemini, creating the ***I Understand ↔ I Think***

The counterpart to the analytical Virgo is the edge-surfing Pisces, creating the ***I Analyze↔I Believe*** spectrum


<center><img src='../Images/astrigridv2_1.png' style='width:80%'/></center>

In the above chart, we assign the same Yin/Yang values for the elements and Tholonic descriptions as we have been using all along. **Negotiation** has no value (because it is both values combined). In the lower left of each cell is the binary value (and the decimal equivalent) of the column and row. In the left two columns, we have six cells made up of two primary lines and four cells made up of bigrams. The right is the virtual equivalent, which is consistent with the scheme of duality that exists in both models.

We have to decide in what order the binary values should be assigned. For example, column *Earth*~0~ and row **Definition**~1~ we can create the pair of 10 (row/col) or 01 (col/row), depending on which comes first, the column or the row. How do we choose the order? The first thing to understand is that either order is correct, as they are two different perspectives of the same thing. In our case, we want to select the order that displays the most symmetry and coherence.

<img src='../Images/math2.png' style='float:right;width:20%'/>When comparing the two methods of listing values, column/row (col/row) versus row/column (row/col), we find that the col/row method reveals a clearer symmetry and pattern. The image on the right demonstrates this comparison: the col/row arrangement (right side) is distinctly more structured than the row/col arrangement (left side).

Due to this clearer symmetry, we will adopt the col/row method for determining positions within the tholon. In the corresponding astrological associations (shown below), the signs consisting exclusively of either Yang (1 <img src='../Images/bc/yang.png' style='width:35px'/>) or Yin (0 <img src='../Images/bc/yin.png' style='width:35px'/>) form the four outer boundaries, while the bigrams are located inside the Tholonic structure.


<center><img src='../Images/tho-ast-bin.png' style='width:80%'/></center>

The cardinal signs, composed exclusively of single-line types—either Yang (1 <img src='../Images/bc/yang.png' style='width:35px'/>) or Yin (0 <img src='../Images/bc/yin.png' style='width:35px'/>)—correspond neatly with all the **Negotiation** signs. For example, the left side of the upper tholon consists of *Earth*–*Fire*–*Earth*, sharing a common boundary defined by the cardinal *Earth* sign, Capricorn.

Additionally, the diagonal axis leading into the virtual (lower) tholon extends from Leo to Taurus, positioned symmetrically relative to the Capricorn cusp. This diagonal crosses into the lower right section of the virtual tholon, which is characterized by *Air*–*Air*–*Water*, situated between Gemini and Aquarius. This pair is similarly centered around their shared boundary, the cardinal *Air* sign, Libra.

This structural pattern repeats consistently across all four quadrants. Significantly, the **Negotiation** signs, which represent child *N*-states, form the outer boundary, providing the context necessary to generate new child instances. Conversely, all non-*N*-state signs converge toward the central Tholonic N-cluster, representing the parent *N*-state.



<img src='../Images/tho-ast-bin_leo_aqu_zod.png' style='float:right;width:100%'/>A historically intriguing observation emerges when examining the two central triangles that intersect at the center of the astrological tholon depicted above. Prior to the discovery of the extra-Saturnian planets (Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto), the cusp connecting Leo and Aquarius represented a highly significant division within traditional astrology. In the far-right image above, the zodiac is oriented so that this Leo–Aquarius axis is vertical.

Interestingly, rather than aligning neatly with the four cardinal points marking the seasons (spring/fall equinoxes or summer/winter solstices), the Leo–Aquarius cusp is offset by 30° from the solstices and 60° from the equinoxes. This arrangement creates a distinctive planetary pattern that appears asymmetrical relative to the seasonal divisions, yet maintains a symmetrical balance around the Leo–Aquarius axis—highlighting its historical importance as a fundamental dividing line in classical astrological tradition.

The three axes created by dividing the 12 zodiac signs into elemental groups, that is, each axis corresponding to one set of four elements, clearly reveal a meaningful pattern from the Tholonic perspective. The two additional diagonal axes in the zodiac chart directly align with the outer borders of the Tholonic model. This alignment alone offers strong validation, but an even more remarkable observation emerges regarding the placement of the spring equinox within this adjusted zodiac orientation. Specifically, the spring equinox aligns precisely at the 4:00 position, which we've previously identified as marking the start of a new daily cycle.

You might reasonably question this alignment, thinking: *"If we're moving clockwise, we'd be traversing the zodiac backward. If we flip the zodiac to correct this, wouldn't the spring equinox then appear at 8:00 rather than 4:00?"* Indeed, that would be true if we were observing only the annual cycle. However, when considering the *precession of the equinoxes*—a 25,772-year cycle caused by Earth's gradual axial shift—the perspective changes dramatically. Precession causes the equinox points to slowly drift westward through the zodiac, opposite to the annual eastward movement. Thus, this reversed, clockwise traversal through the signs accurately represents the larger, precessional cycle.

This insight gives us a unified timeframe, compatible with both models, within which all planetary and zodiacal relationships can be understood. Specifically, the 4:00 position signifies the start of a major new cycle, corresponding historically to the *Age of Pisces*, which began around *1 BCE to 1 CE*.

Remarkably, this alignment is the first clear demonstration, at least to my knowledge, that the precession of the equinoxes could be directly inferred from the zodiac itself.

Following this interpretation, if the 4:00 position signifies the start of a new cycle around 1 BCE to 1 CE, then our most recent symbolic "midnight” and/or “high noon" occurred around 8,650 BCE. This date aligns historically with the end of the Younger Dryas period and the close of the Pleistocene Ice Age, marking humanity’s transition into the Holocene Epoch. It was precisely during this transformative period that humans shifted towards agriculture and established permanent settlements, notably at Göbekli Tepe in Turkey and Jericho in the West Bank—one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. This era also closely follows a series of hypothesized catastrophic events [^3][^4][^5][^6][^7][^8][^9][^10] that may have led to the rapid extinction of numerous large animal species and potentially disrupted or erased previously advanced civilizations, as suggested by various researchers [^11][^12].

## The Lines

##### Note: Except for the graphic at the end of this chapter, the red and blue text used in the tables below is not related to the RGB colors of the tholon as has been used up until now. They were chosen for their ease of readability and contrast*.

There is another compelling reason to consider astrology alongside the Tholonic model. As illustrated earlier by the number wheel and tholon, astrology inherently consists of six attribute pairs, each pair representing complementary perspectives of a unified, overarching *uber* concept. Remarkably, these pairs correspond neatly with the six lines of change found in the I Ching. By applying the logic of the Tholonic I Ching and binary systems to astrology, we obtain the detailed chart presented below:

<center><img src='../Images/tho-zod.png' style='width:70%'/></center>

Here's how to interpret the chart clearly:

- **Color-coding:**
  - Blue text represents Yang attributes.
  - Red text represents Yin attributes.
- **Background shading:**
  - Yellow backgrounds represent Inner states, aligning with the *real* or upper triad in the tholon.
  - Green backgrounds represent Outer states, aligning with the *virtual* or lower triad in the tholon.

Each Tholonic property (**Negotiation**, **Definition**, **Contribution**) manifests in four distinct states within any given context. For instance, considering the property of **Negotiation** within the context of **NATURE**, the possible states are:

- Activity (Inner-Yang)
- Nurturing (Inner-Yin, default)
- Harmony (Outer-Yang, default)
- Ambition (Outer-Yin)

The default state for any context is determined by matching the intrinsic nature (Yin or Yang) of the property to the nature of its context. Thus, a Yin attribute within a Yin context (Inner-Yin) or a Yang attribute within a Yang context (Outer-Yang) is considered a default state.

This structured presentation clarifies the previously hidden connections between astrology, the Tholonic model, and the binary interpretations of the I Ching, highlighting their compatibility and mutual reinforcement.

- Below is an explanation of how the information from the chart above can be applied to the hexagram structure shown here:

  <center><img src='../Images/tho-zod-2.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

  To validate this relationship, let's carefully examine the progression of the I Ching’s “Nature” column, observing how clearly the inner (yellow) and outer (green) definitions align with each step in the hexagram process:

  - **INCEPTION** (**Negotiation**, Harmony):
     	Represents the balanced foundation needed to initiate any new state or concept.
  - **SPECIFICATION** (**Definition**, Stability):
     - Must be clear, stable, and consistent to establish firm boundaries and criteria.
  
  - **DEPLOYMENT** (**Contribution**, Visualization):
     - Requires envisioning how the concept will manifest and integrate within its intended context.
  
  - **EMERGENCE** (**Negotiation**, Nurturing):
     - Involves careful guidance and attention, as emerging conditions are vulnerable and full of uncertainty.
  
  - **SYNTHESIS** (**Definition**, Imagination):
     - Marks the stage of peak expression and fulfillment, creatively combining previously separate elements into a cohesive whole.
  
  - **DIFFUSION** (**Contribution**, Practicality):
     - Signifies the phase of integration back into the larger context, ensuring the creation’s impact and legacy are preserved.
  
  
  This alignment demonstrates a coherent, structured correspondence between the Tholonic framework, astrological attributes, and the hexagram sequence, validating the robustness and consistency of the model.

Let’s make this even simpler to illustrate another point.

<center><img src='../Images/tho-zod-3.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

If we were to apply the above charts to hex [64<img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB21.png' style='width:20px'/>~21~ ***After Completion***] and [63<img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB42.png' style='width:20px'/>~42~ **Before Completion**] using the values from the “Nature” and “Personal” columns, we would get the following:

<center><img src='../Images/tho-zod-4.png' style='width:80%'/></center>

This shows that, according to the Tholonic model using traditionally Western values, the archetype of INCEPTION in a “Natural” context is *Harmony*, and its inverted concept is *Activity*. Likewise, on a more individual, subjective front, the archetype of INCEPTION is *I Balance*, and its inverted concept is *I Am*. Looking at all the pairs, we see the same well-matched dualities.

There remains one final step: reducing the twelve astrological attributes down to six overarching pairs. This step is straightforward, and the resulting structure is illustrated clearly in the left-hand image below. We've included the blue text circle to label the unified qualities represented by each pair—qualities previously expressed as twelve separate attributes in Western astrology. These six primary attributes align neatly and intuitively with the pink circle representing the corresponding attributes of the six lines of change in the I Ching.

On the right is the previously discussed diagram depicting the eight trigrams. Together, these two images—lines (left) and trigrams (right)—present complementary yet distinct creation models. The “Lines Model” (left) follows the Tholonic pattern: starting with one entity, which generates two; these two then mirror to produce six; and finally, through inversion, produce twelve. By contrast, the “Trigrams Model” (right) employs a binary tree pattern: beginning with one entity that divides into two, each subsequently dividing again, yielding four, and then each dividing once more to produce eight.

Together, these models illustrate the harmonious interplay of Tholonic logic and binary structure, effectively bridging Eastern (I Ching) and Western (astrology) frameworks.

# IV: Synthesis

## Primordial Patterns and the Structure of Creation


We are going to zoom way out now to get an even broader, but more in-depth picture of the natural processes in play in the hopes it will add insight into the Tholonic model and the I Ching.

The Tholonic model is rooted in the ancient principle that from singularity arises duality. This is evident in the idea without *something*, the very notion of *nothing* would not exist, as *nothingness* is only meaningful in contrast to its opposite There is no argument as to which came first, as they can only exist simultaneously.

The concepts of 1 and 0 are the simplest and most practical concepts to represent this contrast of duality. In the context of mathematics, the sum of the parts of a whole equals the whole, so we can then say that 1 + 0 = 1, which tells us the whole equals 1. This sounds like 1<sup>st</sup> grade math… but let’s continue.

We can plot this a few different ways:


<center><img src='../Images/numbers-1_1.png' style='width:50%'/></center>

If this is a true statement, then it must be true for all numbers. Let’s try this with the first, and only the first, 8 (octal) numbers, 0-7, by making every pair of numbers that equals 7: 7+0, 6+1, 5+2, and 4+3, just like how the original pair of opposites, 1 and 0, equal the value of the parent, which *must* be 1.


<center><img src='../Images/numbers-1_2.png' style='width:80%'/></center>

Now we have a problem because, as is shown in the above one-level tree chart, we have four 7s, which when split make all the numbers 0-7, but what then are the two parents of these four 7s? If we apply the same logic, then those four 7s would have the two parents of 14 (**o**16) and 14 (**o**16), and we can’t have two parents of the same value. The problem is that any number we use as a parent number must be odd to create two children that are unique, but then we and up with two even valued grandparents, which isn’t allowed. In addition, if the top number is even, the number of possible pairs is an odd number. 

The challenge is that there is no existing number to represent parents. To solve this, we need to create new numbers—just as mathematics has done before with concepts like *imaginary numbers* and *pure imaginary numbers*, such as *i* (the square root of -1). Similarly, we will introduce our own set of imaginary numbers, which we will call *primordial numbers*.


<center><img src='../Images/number-chart.png' style='width:100%'/></center>



A primordial value can be defined as numeric concept that always instantiates as exactly two distinct numeric values whose sum equals the primordial number itself.

We need a number that can *simultaneously represent two (or more) distinct values that are inherently unequal*. This seemingly paradoxical requirement finds a close parallel in *quantum mechanics*. In quantum theory, a particle's state, such as *spin*, can exist in a *superposition*, holding multiple values at once until measured. Furthermore, *entanglement* demonstrates that two particles, regardless of distance, can be *correlated in a way that defies classical logic*. One particle’s measurement instantly determines the state of the other. This suggests that, at a fundamental level, reality does not always conform to a single, well-defined state but rather an *interdependent structure of potentialities*.

Similarly, our *primordial number* must function in a way that allows it to exist in multiple states at once, akin to a quantum superposition. For an accessible and insightful discussion of these ideas, see Quanta Magazine’s article *"Entanglement Made Simple"*.[^2]

[^2]: Quanta Magazine, *"Entanglement Made Simple,"* April 28, 2016. Available at https://www.quantamagazine.org/entanglement-made-simple-20160428/

In short: A primordial value can be defined as numeric concept that always instantiates as exactly two distinct numeric values whose sum equals the primordial number itself.

We can now apply this idea to our tree of 7, going all the way to the top, where we have the meta-value, or *first-order primordial number*, of A, which represents one unit from which these eight numbers emerge in the following manner.

<center><img src='../Images/numbers-1_3.png' style='width:80%'/></center>

We start with A and its first pair, which consists of A<sub>0</sub> and A<sub>1</sub>. On the next row, each one of those meta-values has its own pair, so A<sub>0</sub> has A<sub>01</sub> and A<sub>00</sub>, etc.

##### *Note: Don’t be confused if you are looking at the binary sub-indexes and seeing they do not match the decimal values. They are not suppose to be the same. This is explained in the next paragraphs.*

This can be demonstrated better in the following circular charts.

<center><img src='../Images/numbers-1_4.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

At the bottom of the above tree, we have eight states of A, each identified by the sub-index value representing its unique lineage from A. If you understand binary numbers, you’ll notice that the sub-indexes follow the perfect sequential order of 76543210 (starting from the left), yet the number they represent has a very different order: 70615243. This seems to make no logical sense, but in fact, it is an amazing relationship.

The sub-index values represent the path of expression from A, or position within the tree, that resulted in a number value. This is the *order of instantiation* (*OI*), while the value itself is the *value of instantiation* (*VI*). Look at how these two sets of values relate to one another. Below (top left) are the binary and decimal values for the *OI* sub-indexes and the value, *VI*, of that number.

<img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/numbers-1_5_2.png" style='width:100%'/>

In the top right form, the *value of instantiation* (*VI*) axis is perpendicular to the *order of instantiation* (*OI*) axis. These two axes are perfectly in sync with each other in two different axes and seem to be a natural process of reordering in a very efficient form of encoding (and therefore decoding) as the *value of instantiation* is an encoded version of the *order of instantiation*, and vice versa.  Notice also that the OI order automatically pairs values, which is an excellent example of solf-ordering.

We can see that no VI number can exist without having an implicit OI number, meaning each number must have two attributes: an attribute of how it is expressed (VI) and an attribute of how it came to exist (OI), and each of these must be unique.

The lower right form shows the four trigrams made of the parent and two children each. We still see the order, but it is in two sets. The lower left image shows how these values could be mapped to a tholon.

The relationship between *Order of Instantiation (OI)* and *Value of Instantiation (VI)* closely parallels the fundamental interplay between *electricity* and *magnetism* in physics. In electromagnetism, a changing electric field produces a magnetic field, and a changing magnetic field produces an electric field, two inseparable forces that always appear together and exist perpendicular to each other in space. Similarly, *OI* and *VI* exist in a perpendicular relationship, with *OI* representing the structured *path of emergence*, or the functions that brought it into being, and *VI* representing the representation or *form* of a number, how it instantiates, interacts, and expresses itself within the system, so, essentially, *form* and *function*.

This duality extends to other fundamental principles in physics: in quantum mechanics, position and momentum are complementary attributes that cannot be fully understood in isolation, and in relativity, space and time form a unified framework that defines all events. Likewise, in this model, every number must possess both an *OI* (function, structural definition) and a *VI* (form, functional expression), and together, they create a complete instantiation system. Each defines the other, forming an interdependent and self-sustaining system.

The significance of this duality suggests that the encoding of information in numbers follows a natural law of emergence, much like how electromagnetism encodes energy in waves. The perpendicular nature of OI and VI may reflect an efficient way for numerical systems to self-organize, much like how physical systems adopt the most stable and efficient configurations. This hints at a deeper *universal principle of structured emergence*, where the process by which something is instantiated is as fundamental as what it does once instantiated.

Technically speaking (and I need to say that because what comes next sounds quite esoteric, but it’s not meant to be), every instance, which is every *thing* that exists, is an expression the *One Thing* that all existence came from. In this example, that would be the primal A. In the Tholonic model, that would be the 0-dimensional dot. In both cases, we see a recombination of the very path that caused an instance to come into existence starting from the beginning of creation. If there is one source or many sources from which everything grew, then every instance, every thing, has a unique *OI* value which describes the path it has taken from its source. Because every OI is unique, so too is the VI.

There is one more perspective that is worth looking at. If we arrange this tree in its most natural evolving form (the synergetics of 60°), we get the following:

<center><img src='../Images/honeymap_2.png' style='width:90%'/></center>

—BEGIN

This OI/VI Chart reveals several fascinating structural and numerical relationships that suggest deeper underlying principles of emergence, encoding, and self-organization. These patterns not only provide insight into the tholonic I Ching but also reflect broader natural principles found in physics, information theory, and structured emergence, which we would expect.

We’ve already addressed the intrinsic law of structured emergence, where every number in this system has a unique OI-VI pairing, meaning that each number simultaneously holds two complementary attributes: its structural pathway (VI, *function*, *how* it emerged) and its functional role (OI, *form*, *what* it becomes). This duality falls squarely into the *Definition* (*how*) / *Contribution* (*what*) spectrum and can be applied to everything that exists.

A particularly unique pattern that emerges in this map is that 7 and 2 are the only values where OI and VI are identical. This means that for these two numbers, the process of *how* they emerged and *what* they ultimately became are fundamentally the same. Such a condition suggests that these numbers represent a kind of equilibrium within the system, where structure and function align perfectly. In self-organizing systems, equilibrium states are often critical points of stability, hinting that 7 and 2 play a special role in balancing or anchoring the system as a whole.

The role of 3/4, which si the only point of overlap between values, show the total OI=7 and the total VI=6.  This unique instance further emphasizes the unique nature of 7.  It also shows that 7 exists in two forms: once as a fusion of 3 and 4, and once as its own independent identity. Interestingly, the central vertical position of 3+4 as 7 is only shared by the primal "A," suggesting a unique connection between them, possibly linked to the fundamental process of creation. Additionally, 7~34~ (as 3+4) is the only OI value that emerges directly from the simplest duality of indexes A~10~ and A~01~, this shortest of all paths to A, reinforcing its role as a structurally significant number, as well as how 7 and 2 are points of equilibrium.  

We asked the AI to analyze the "OI values only" and "VI values only" maps, comparing their rows and columns to determine which exhibited greater order. The evaluation considered factors such as symmetry, pattern consistency, numeric and color consistency, and predictability. Interestingly, the AI found significantly more order in the OI values than in the VI values, suggesting the OI values reveal a higher degree of order when viewed non-linearly. It also found increased order in Map 3, where the primal "A" is positioned at the center of the hexagram rather than at the top or bottom, which aligns intuitively with expectations.

There may be multiple ways to plot this pattern of the emergent process, but the most obvious and appropriate in this case would be to map the 4 pairs of values onto two tetrahedrons, which works perfectly well with the OI pairs where every opposing pair of values equals 7, as shown below. Since two tetrahedrons form a cube, we can easily map the values to the cube.

This reveals an interesting pattern, with all the odd numbers on the top and all the even numbers on the bottom, both following a specific direction of increment. Following that pattern, we arrive at the classic symbol of infinity, which now has volume and a direction of movement.

<center><img src='../Images/OI_tholon_2.png' style='width:80%'/></center>

Now it appears that the OI pattern, which requires three dimensions, reveals a highly appropriate and specific representation of the movement of energy.

The infinity symbol (∞) was first used by the mathematician John Wallis (1655), inspired by the Roman symbol for 1,000 (CIƆ or M). However, the symbol’s origins trace back as far as 1600 BCE in the Egyptian Ouroboros, the symbol of a serpent eating its own tail, representing eternity and endless cycles.

I suspect that the ancients may have known of this tetrahedral-cube-based origin as well, but that knowledge was lost over time.

> > Our primordial numeric system, producing the OI and VI orders, naturally self-organizes into a double tetrahedron, a structure defining a complete Tholon composed of both a real and a virtual tetrahedron. Remarkably, these two tetrahedrons perfectly combine to form a cube, the foundational structure underpinning Cartesian reality. This complete Tholon, the cornerstone of the Tholonic model, elegantly illustrates the fundamental process of creation itself. Specifically, the OI pairs establish limitation and definition, determining the underlying numeric structure, while the VI pairs provide contribution and integration, manifesting as instantiated numeric values. These instantiated values, expressed as the octal and binary (base-2) number systems, form the practical numeric foundation utilized in mathematics and embodied in all modern digital technology. Thus, we observe a clear parallel: the defining, limiting principles (OI) represent the numeric creation process, while the integrative, contributing principles (VI) provide the actual numeric values that sustain our models of reality, such as mathematics and technology.

## DNA


We see these same patterns of progression, specifically the recursive splitting from core concepts into sub-concepts, the generation of opposites and their inversions, and the spatial reorientation into symmetric triads, in the most fundamental form of creation: genetics. Below is a graph that illustrates how the bases of adenine (*A*), cytosine (*C*), guanine (*G*), and thymine (*T*) pair together to form nucleotides. An *A* can only double bond with a *T*, and *C* can only triple bond with a *G*. This is accomplished by taking one side, inverting it (a negative image), then reversing it (horizontal flip). When we do that, the pairs automatically line up in their proper order. In the image below, we see the same concepts as above by considering the bases of *A, T, G, C* to be the instantiable form of some *meta-base*, or some instantiable archetype, such as the mate-base values that produce the numbers we saw above but are inexpressible. These are represented as the half-circles and full circles. We also assign sub-index values representing their paths, and, as you can see, every pair has two values that equal 3.

The intention is to show how at least one aspect of the mechanics of a DNA strand follows the same order, or pattern, of this archetype of *hierarchical primordial numbers* and that of many natural processes. For example, the parent of the bonded bases could be the concept of the class of compounds called purines or pyrimidines. Their parent, the source, could be the class of aromatic heterocyclic organic compounds, of which all the children are a member. Or perhaps it could be *Chargaff’s Rule*, which states, “DNA must have equal parts of GC and AT nucleotides.” There could be many different instances of these parents, but in every case, they will follow the same pattern of expression.


<center><img src='../Images/dna-clr.png' style='width:80%'/></center>

This inversion and reversal process is the same mechanism used in the I Ching, demonstrating how only 16 original hexagrams are needed to create 64 hexagrams, or rather, 32 inverted pairs of archetypes.

What is especially interesting is that the opposite (inverted and flipped) of the purine compound adenine is the pyrimidine compound thymine. This is significant because there cannot truly be an “opposite” of a compound, molecule, or atom in a strict chemical sense. However, there can be two compounds that function in an opposite manner within a specific context or task, where this “opposition” typically manifests as complementarity. In other contexts, these compounds behave very differently—such as how adenine is also used in cellular metabolism to transfer chemical energy between reactions.

From a Tholonic perspective, this demonstrates that the structure of a process is independent of the specific instances that apply it. This strongly suggests that the process archetype exists before it is instantiated.

This conclusion is a radical observation, as it implies that process and structure can exist independently of substance. In other words, DNA does not derive its form from the compounds that compose it—rather, the form exists as an archetype, and compounds that are compatible with that archetypal form naturally align with it.

We can validate this idea by identifying similar forms in DNA that also appear elsewhere. Many such examples exist in language and writing systems, neural networks and brain structures, crystals and quasicrystals, planetary and orbital resonance, economics and trade, software code, and computer algorithms, to name just a few.

There are correlations between the I Ching and DNA. For example, if we replace DNA concepts with I Ching concepts, we can say the following:


<center><img src='../Images/iching-dna.png' style='width:100%'/></center>



## Elements


In keeping with the traditional I Ching, we want to assign familiar real-world elements and properties. Using archetypes to describe a scene or function can be very helpful in tapping into our intuitive understanding. The traditional elements of the I Ching are: water, fire, wood, metal, and earth. These elements are traditionally said to work together in a sort of paper/rock/scissors manner:

> - Wood generates Fire, Fire generates Earth, Earth generates Metal, Metal generates Water and Water generates Wood.
>
> - Wood weakens Water, Water weakens Metal, Metal weakens Earth, Earth weakens Fire and Fire weakens Wood.
>
> - Wood controls Earth, Earth controls Water, Water controls Fire, Fire controls Metal and Metal controls Wood.
>
> - Wood insults Metal, Metal insults Fire, Fire insults Water, Water insults Earth and Earth insults Wood.

However, we are using Western *primordial* elements here as they are a better fit and are more flexible in general. For the cardinal points, we have the four classics of *Air*, *Water*, *Earth*, and *Fire*. We italicize these archetypes to distinguish them from the physical elements. These archetypes represent qualities and properties of the elements that can be found in anything, and not simply the physical instances of air, water, earth, and fire.

We have also adopted the astrological/Neo-Platonic qualities of these elements. Of course, any other definitions could be used to create interpretations that are consistent with other perspectives.


<center><img src='../Images/elements.png' style='width:80%'/></center>

### Here are the explanations of the cardinal and transitional elements with their reasoning and correlation with the triads.

### <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/e_earth.png" style='width:30px'/>***EARTH*** <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/trigram-b00.png" style='width:60px'/> 0

*Earth* represents the foundation upon which everything is built as well as the resources from which they are built. It is cardinal, winter solstice, inward, the non-moving point between deflation and inflation. Instances of this are **resources**, **foundations**, **support**.

The trigram shows the symbol of a perfect Yin state.

The quadrant of *Earth* <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/trigram-b00.png" style='width:30px'/> exists between the dynamic properties of *Emptying* <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/trigram-b04.png" style='width:30px'/> and *Filling* <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/trigram-b01.png" style='width:30px'/> and therefore represents the extreme Yin pole, where the maximum point of *Emptying* is reached and where *Filling* begins. In this way, it is also a tipping point

1.  **Negotiation** <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/yin.png" style='width:30px'/>
    In the context of *Earth*, a Yin *Negotiation* represents a passive yet fertile foundation, ready to receive and shape whatever is introduced. Like soil awaiting a seed, it does not impose restrictions on what it can accept, but the nature of what grows depends on the surrounding conditions. Just as a swamp lily will struggle in a desert, the environment itself negotiates what can take root and thrive.
2.  **Definition** <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/yin.png" style='width:30px'/>
    A Yin *Definition* in the context of *Earth* signifies a state shaped entirely by external influences. It does not impose its own structure but provides the foundation upon which all else is built. Like clay in the hands of a potter or water conforming to its container, *Earth* as Yin *Definition* is formed by the forces that act upon it. It remains receptive while offering stability to whatever takes shape upon it.
3.  **Contribution** <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/yin.png" style='width:30px'/>
    In the context of *Earth*, a Yin *Contribution* provides the space and conditions necessary for Yang to emerge. It does not act directly but enables creation by its presence alone. Just as zero defines the space in which one can exist or emptiness allows form to arise, *Earth’s* contribution is its stability and receptivity, forming the foundation upon which all else is built.

### <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/e_water.png" style='width:30px'/>***WATER*** <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/trigram-b02.png" style='width:60px'/> 2

*Water* represents the movement from darkness to light, Yin to Yang, lifelessness to life. It is cardinal, associated with the spring equinox, the season of ascending energy and renewal. Water embodies the perfect balance of lessening Yin and increasing Yang, symbolizing flow, adaptability, and transformation. Instances of this include **electricity**, **nourishment**, **cleansing**, and **rivers**.

The quadrant of *Water* <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/trigram-b02.png" style='width:30px'/> exists between the dynamic properties of *Filling* <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/trigram-b01.png" style='width:30px'/> and *Collecting* <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/trigram-b03.png" style='width:30px'/>. It represents the balance between Yin and Yang, achieved when Yang penetrates Yin at its center. Oceans and lakes fill and become still, but water collects and returns to the river, initiating movement that naturally flows back to its source. Water is the most inward-moving of all states, always seeking depth and unity.

The trigram shows the symbol of Yang energy penetrating Yin at its core, illustrating that water, though yielding, is defined by movement and flow.

1. **Negotiation** <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/yin.png" style='width:30px'/>
   In the context of *Water*, a Yin *Negotiation* represents absolute adaptability. *Water* does not resist, it cedes to whatever holds it, taking the shape of its container. However, this is not passivity but a dynamic flexibility, allowing it to move through, around, and even erode what confines it.

- **Definition** <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/yang.png" style='width:30px'/>
  A Yang definition in the context of *Water* signifies that movement is its defining characteristic. *Water* exists only in motion, whether as a river carving valleys, currents shaping the ocean, or electricity flowing through a circuit. Unlike *Earth*, which defines through structure, *Water* defines through its ability to move, change, and sustain.

- **Contribution** <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/yin.png" style='width:30px'/>
  In the context of *Water*, a Yin *Contribution* is its ability to give without depletion. *Water* follows the path of least resistance, nourishing all life and ecosystems before returning to its source, essentially unchanged yet transformative. It takes nothing, yet gives everything, embodying the nature of growth, renewal, and expansion.

### <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/e_wind.png" style='width:30px'/>Air <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/trigram-b07.png" style='width:60px'/> 7

*Air* represents the arena of growth and creation. What emerges from the Yin of *Earth* expands into the Yang of *Air*. It is the force that holds all things in place, yet it is also symbolic of spirit, revealing a life that extends beyond earthly limitations. It is cardinal, associated with the summer solstice, and represents outward expansion. Air is the non-moving point between inflation and deflation, the moment of fullness before release. Instances of this include **birth**, **exploration**, and **imagination**.

The quadrant of *Air* <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/trigram-b07.png" style='width:30px'/> exists between the dynamic properties of *Collecting* <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/trigram-b03.png" style='width:30px'/> and *Releasing* <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/trigram-b06.png" style='width:30px'/>. It represents the turning point where the internal journey transitions into the external journey. This is the extreme Yang pole, the moment when the process of Collecting reaches its maximum, and Releasing must soon begin.

1. **Negotiation** <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/yang.png" style='width:30px'/>
   In the context of *Air*, a Yang *Negotiation* seeks movement, expansion, and creation. *Air* does not settle; it actively explores, reaching outward to interact with the Yin. Just as the wind finds every gap and fills every space, *Air* is in constant search of new frontiers, never bound by limitations.

- **Definition** <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/yang.png" style='width:30px'/>
  A Yang definition in the context of *Air* arises through discovery. The unknown is Yin in nature, but the act of exploring it is Yang. It is only by venturing into the unknown that boundaries are defined and limitations are revealed. Like the first breath of life or the expansion of thought, Air moves forward without hesitation, shaping its world by uncovering its edges.

- **Contribution** <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/yang.png" style='width:30px'/>
  In the context of *Air*, a Yang *Contribution* is the force that opens new doors and reveals new horizons. *Air* does not preserve the past; it propels existence forward, clearing away the stagnant and bringing fresh energy. Just as the wind carries seeds to distant lands or ideas spread through inspiration, *Air’s* contribution is the endless renewal of possibilities.

### <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/e_fire.png" style='width:30px'/>***FIRE*** <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/trigram-b05.png" style='width:60px'/> 5

*Fire* represents the force that allows manifestation, transforming idea into form. It is cardinal, associated with the fall equinox, and represents descent and release. It embodies the perfect balance of lessening Yang and increasing Yin, symbolizing transformation, consumption, and illumination. Instances of this include **light** and **consumption**.

The trigram shows the symbol of Yang on the outside but is dependent on a Yin center, much like a fire that shines light while consuming its fuel. As the Yang dissipates, the form it sustained is reduced to ashes, revealing the cyclical nature of creation and destruction.

The quadrant of *Fire* <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/trigram-b05.png" style='width:30px'/> exists between the dynamic properties of *Releasing* <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/trigram-b06.png" style='width:30px'/> and *Emptying* <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/trigram-b04.png" style='width:30px'/>. It represents the dissipation of energy, the process through which form emerges and light is revealed. This is the zenith of outward expression, where energy reaches its peak before surrendering to entropy.

- **Negotiation** <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/yang.png" style='width:30px'/>
  In the context of *Fire*, a Yang *Negotiation* is the buildup of energy that seeks release. *Fire* does not hesitate; it ignites, consumes, and transforms. Just as a flame must burn to fulfill its purpose, *Fire* is always in the process of exchanging energy, preparing to radiate outward.

- **Definition** <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/yin.png" style='width:30px'/>
  A Yin definition in the context of *Fire* signifies the return of Yin as Yang is released. *Fire* is defined not by what it holds, but by what it gives away. As energy dissipates, form takes shape, but only for a moment before it, too, is consumed. Like the glow of embers or the fading warmth of a sunset, *Fire’s* nature is entropy: the dissolution of structure into energy.

- **Contribution** <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/yang.png" style='width:30px'/>
  In the context of *Fire*, a Yang *Contribution* is the act of sharing energy with the world. *Fire* does not keep its power contained; it radiates light, heat, and movement, illuminating everything it touches. Whether as the warmth of the sun, the blaze of a hearth, or the spark of inspiration, *Fire’s* gift is transformation, giving all of itself so that something new may arise.



## Transitional or Dynamic Interactions


### ***Release*** <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/trigram-b06.png" style='width:60px'/> 6  (AIR <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/trigram-b07.png" style='width:30px'/><img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/e_wind.png" style='width:30px'/> & FIRE <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/trigram-b05.png" style='width:30px'/><img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/e_fire.png" style='width:30px'/>)

*Release* represents accumulated energy that seeks balance. In the process of balancing itself, it dissipates both itself and its recipient, leading to transformation. It is the initial outward movement that leads to expression. Instances of this include **lightning**, the **Big Bang**, and **inspiration**.

The trigram shows the symbol of Yin energy re-entering solid Yang. A new Yin line appears in the lowest position, representing beginning, birth, and idea. The middle line remains Yang, showing that Yang is still dominant in this phase. Because of this, the transition remains Yang in nature, signifying a dynamic release of energy.

The quadrant of *Air* <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/trigram-b07.png" style='width:30px'/> and *Fire* <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/trigram-b05.png" style='width:30px'/> is one of outward-descending movement, or external Yang. Here, Yang has reached the limits of sustainability and must move in the opposite direction. When extreme Yang mixes with Yin, there is a powerful release of energy, resulting in *Fire*. This quadrant is outward because creation is a process where energy (yang) takes form (yin), and form exists in the outer world. It is descending because Yang expands, and in doing so, it also dissipates itself.

1.  **Negotiation** <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/yin.png" style='width:30px'/>
    When Yang energy reaches completion, it has nowhere left to go—it must interact with Yin. At this point, Yang becomes dependent on Yin for its continued existence, marking a shift where Yang is subservient to Yin. Just as a storm builds until it has no choice but to discharge lightning, the balance between forces now dictates the outcome.
2.  **Definition** <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/yang.png" style='width:30px'/>
    When Yang meets Yin, it seeks immediate release, pushing against the boundaries imposed by Yin. This pressure defines the moment of transition, where energy moves into form but does so explosively. The moment before a star ignites or an idea is expressed is the tension of Yang pushing against its limits, eager to break free.
3.  **Contribution** <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/yang.png" style='width:30px'/>
    The expression of Yang manifests as *Fire*, consuming the Yin as it releases its energy. This is the moment of illumination, ignition, and transformation—where what was once stored potential becomes a force of action. Whether in the form of a burning flame, a flash of inspiration, or the explosive power of creation, *Fire* is the visible result of release.

### ***Emptying*** <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/trigram-b04.png" style='width:60px'/> 4 (FIRE <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/trigram-b05.png" style='width:30px'/><img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/e_fire.png" style='width:30px'/> & EARTH <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/trigram-b00.png" style='width:30px'/><img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/e_earth.png" style='width:30px'/>)

*Emptying* represents the dissipation and movement of energy through matter. It is the process that brings order out of chaos, the final outward deflation that returns energy to its primordial state, completing the cycle of creation. Instances of this include **music**, the creation of the **elements**, and **death**.

The quadrant of *Fire* <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/trigram-b05.png" style='width:30px'/> and *Earth* <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/trigram-b00.png" style='width:30px'/> represents final descension, or external Yin, where the energy of *Fire* dissipates and transforms into *Earth*. This quadrant is external because *Fire* transitions into *Earth*, moving from pure energy into structure. It is descending because the energy of creation wanes and stabilizes, shifting from the active state of *Fire* to the structured state of *Earth*. This is the process that converts energy into mass (*m=E/c^2^*), where the dissolution of *Fire* gives rise to the solid reality of *Earth*.

##### Historical footnote: m=E/c^2^, not E=mc^2^, was the original formula that Einstein introduced.  It later became  E=mc^2^ for convenience sake.

1. **Negotiation** <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/yin.png" style='width:30px'/>
   In the dynamic between *Fire* and *Earth*, *Fire* is always dependent on *Earth* for expression. Energy alone has no form, it requires a medium through which it can be observed and experienced. Just as flames must consume fuel, *Fire* can only act within the structure provided by *Earth*.

- **Definition** <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/yin.png" style='width:30px'/>
  *Fire* finds its limits and boundaries in *Earth*, just as energy is only measurable through matter. Without *Earth*, *Fire* would burn without definition, unable to take shape. The constraints of *Earth* determine the expression of *Fire*, just as the properties of physical matter determine how energy manifests in the world.

- **Contribution** <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/yang.png" style='width:30px'/>
  The restructuring of matter by energy is what brings everything into existence. *Fire* reshapes and transforms *Earth*, creating new patterns, forms, and structures. Whether in the fusion of elements in a star, the creative process of music, or the transformation of life into death and renewal, emptying is the action that finalizes creation by dissolving energy into structure.

### ***Filling*** <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/trigram-b01.png" style='width:60px'/> 1 (EARTH <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/trigram-b00.png" style='width:30px'/><img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/e_earth.png" style='width:30px'/>& WATER <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/trigram-b01.png" style='width:30px'/><img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/e_water.png" style='width:30px'/>)

*Filling* represents form coming to life. It is the initial inward inflation of a new cycle, the moment when energy begins to enter and shape an empty vessel. Instances of this include **gestation**, **dark matter** (expansion of the universe), and **artificial intelligence**.

The trigram shows the return of Yang energy in the lowest position, signifying the first movement toward manifestation. However, the center remains Yin, meaning the process is still within the domain of receptivity rather than full expression.

The quadrant of *Earth* <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/trigram-b00.png" style='width:30px'/> and *Water* <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/trigram-b01.png" style='width:30px'/> represents new beginnings, or internal Yin, where the emptiness of *Earth* begins to receive energy and return to life. It is inward because Yang enters from the lowest position and ascending because Yang continues to rise, gradually shaping what was once formless.

1.  **Negotiation** <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/yang.png" style='width:30px'/>
    In the context of *Filling*, a Yang *Negotiation* arises because the absence of Yang naturally draws it inward. Just as a vacuum pulls in air, or an empty vessel invites substance, the void within *Earth* seeks to be filled. The process begins not through force, but through attraction, as Yang enters to restore balance.
2.  **Definition** <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/yin.png" style='width:30px'/>
    A Yin *Definition* in the context of *Filling* signifies that Yang must first shape the empty Yin vessel before it can express itself. Before light can shine, it must have a source; before a seed can grow, it must find soil. Yang is present, but its form is determined by the structure and capacity of *Earth* to hold and shape it.
3.  **Contribution** <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/yin.png" style='width:30px'/>
    In the context of *Filling*, a Yin *Contribution* represents the universal availability of Yang energy, which can be accessed from anywhere. Just as *Earth* serves as an electrical ground for all circuits, the presence of a stable, receptive state allows energy to be drawn upon when needed. *Filling* does not create energy—it opens the space for energy to flow, forming the foundation for all future manifestations.

### ***Collecting*** <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/trigram-b03.png" style='width:60px'/> 3 (WATER <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/trigram-b01.png" style='width:30px'/><img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/e_water.png" style='width:30px'/> & AIR <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/trigram-b07.png" style='width:30px'/><img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/e_wind.png" style='width:30px'/>)

*Collecting* represents the higher orders of structure that extend ever outward. It is the final internal inflation, the stage of completion and preparation before outward expression. Instances of this include the **Internet**, **space-born viruses**, and the **Mongol Empire**, each representing a system that has expanded and gathered momentum before dispersing its influence.

This trigram, with two emerging Yang lines, signifies a shift into the domain of Yang. The structure is still forming, but the final transition toward full Yang dominance is approaching.

The quadrant of *Water* <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/trigram-b01.png" style='width:30px'/> and *Air* <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/trigram-b07.png" style='width:30px'/> represents preparation, or internal Yang, where the balanced state of Water ascends and expands into the polar state of *Air*. This is the moment when gathered energy reaches its peak before transitioning into outward expansion.

1. **Negotiation** <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/yang.png" style='width:30px'/>
   In the context of *Collecting*, a Yang *Negotiation* marks the shift toward dominance, as Yang begins to outnumber and overtake the remaining Yin. This is the turning point where structure is no longer being shaped by constraints but begins to establish its own rules. Like a movement gaining critical mass, this is the moment when preparation nears completion and momentum becomes self-sustaining.

- **Definition** <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/yang.png" style='width:30px'/>
  A Yang definition in the context of *Collecting* signifies the culmination of expression. No longer bound by the limitations of *Earth*, Yang is free to expand into the boundless domain of *Air*. This is the ultimate phase of growth, where an instance reaches its fullest potential, whether as an empire at its height, a network reaching global scale, or an idea expanding beyond its creator.

- **Contribution** <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/yin.png" style='width:30px'/>
  In the context of *Collecting*, a Yin *Contribution* represents what remains after the peak of expansion has passed. The influence of a system, idea, or creation persists beyond its initial expression, leaving a legacy only time can reveal. Like the ripples left by a great movement or the data of the past embedded in the present, Collecting ensures that something endures beyond the moment of expansion itself.# V: Mathematical Foundations of the Tholonic I Ching

## Tholonic Recursion and Emergence of Transcendence


Let us begin at the simplest point imaginable of **N=1**, which represents the singular essence of Awareness and Intention, a unity symbolizing the initial state of *Negotiation*, from which all differentiation emerges.

From this initial state, the Tholonic recursion expands along three functional and philosophical axes:

- **Definition (Limitation)** – the structure, boundaries, and internal order.
- **Contribution (Integration)** – interaction, connection, and form.
- **Instantiation** – the creation resulting from the interplay of *Definition* and *Contribution*.

As previously shown, in the Tholonic model, these concepts can be represented as three points forming a triad. This arrangement results in three vector axes, each representing the movement, process, or nature of the interactions occurring between any two points.

An intriguing challenge when examining these interactions is determining whether they occur progressively over time or simultaneously. The Tholonic perspective suggests that these interactions happen both simultaneously and temporally. A conceptual illustration of this is how we can simultaneously imagine all numbers, yet we can only instantiate them sequentially. This parallels the difference between an archetype and its manifested forms.

A more tangible example would be the Big Bang, where the total sum of all energy in existence was instantaneously released as pure energy. Within approximately 10^-42^ seconds after that instant, the four fundamental forces of nature (gravity, electromagnetism, the strong nuclear force, and the weak nuclear force) were unified. From that unified quantum field of pure energy and fundamental forces emerged particles, which gave rise to nuclei and atoms, eventually leading to stars, planets, life, and everything else that currently exists. Here we have the simultaneous creation of everything at the instant of the Big Bang and the temporally ordered sequence of events that followed.

Applying these ideas to the triad, we can say that teh complete triad exists sumultaniously, and it’s instantes exist tempoirally.

Looking at the process temporally, the interactions between *Negotiation/Balance* moving to *Definition/Limitation*, or 1 moving to 2, is represented by the line that connects N and D.  As a process, this line represent the change from infinite to finite, from one to many, from whole to division. In the context of *Form and Function*, this is the *Form*; what something *is*.

The interaction between C and N, or *Contribution/Integration* moving toward *Negotiation/Balance*, is where the many recreate the one, where the parts contribute back to the whole from which they originally arose. We see this clearly in how living organisms, and indeed all matter, eventually return to the elements from which they were created, just as the Universe itself will ultimately return to the void from which it emerged. This is fundamentally a process of sacrifice, giving back, and death, which can also be understood as another form of recycling. In this sense, this process inherently involves division and separation.  In the context of *Form and Function*, this is the *Function*; what something *does*.

The process of interaction between D and C, between 2 and 3, is the seat of creation, as this is where what something *is* and what what something *does* meet, where *Form* and *Function* unite to create a pattern which has the potential to perpetuate itself, just like the parent that is was crated within. Unlike the divisive nature of the other two vectors, this vector is one of multiplying and adding, making it the process of creation by definition. 

In short, the axes of *Definition* and *Contribution* arise through division (unity splitting into duality), while *Instantiation* emerges via addition and subtraction (recombination into unity).

As a simultaneous creation, where 1,  2,  and 3 come into existence together, we can say that 6 is the value of the triad.  As a process of creation, 6 instantiates as 1, 2, and 3.  In other words, 6 is the *holon* and 1, 2, and 3 are the *partons*. It is no coincidence that 6 is the first “perfect number”, which is when a number whose factors (excluding itself) add up precisely to the number itself.  Ancient cultures and philosophers (such as the Greeks and Pythagoreans) considered perfect numbers to represent harmony, balance, and completeness due to their unique numerical characteristics. 

Perfect numbers are quite rare, and only 51 have been discovered to date. Here are the first eight:
 6, 28, 496, 8128, 33550336, 8589869056, 137438691328, and 2305843008139952128.

In addition, 6 is the factorial of 3, written as 3! (1 × 2 × 3 = 6), making 6 the only number known to be both a perfect number and a factorial number.

Thus, it is not surprising that the progression from 2 to 3 mirrors the process established by their parent 6, which generates 2 and 3 through division.

Assigning the values 1, 2, and 3 to the points of the triad is based on using natural numbers, that is, counting numbers, which exclude 0. This makes sense if we view the triad in the context of the instantiated world, the world of tangible existence. However, when considering archetypes, we should use the set of whole numbers, which includes every integer starting from zero: 0, 1, 2, 3, …., because zero (0) represents the unmanifested or potential state, which precedes any tangible existence. Thus, it naturally aligns with archetypal concepts.

By using whole numbers, we reveal an even more fundamental or archetypal pattern. Assigning the values 0, 1, and 2 to the triad points brings the total value of the triad to 3, clearly illustrating this deeper structure especially given that the number 3 is universally recognized as symbolic of fundamental processes of creation, balance, and manifestation.

To ensure that every combination of points across all generations results in a unique numeric value, each point is assigned a distinct power of two. For example, numbering the *NDC* points as 0, 1, and 2, their assigned values are $2^0 = 1$, $2^1 = 2$, and $2^2 = 4$, respectively. Consequently, each line connecting two points will also yield a unique sum, as illustrated below:

<center><img src='../Images/arxiv-tritest.png' style='width:80%'/></center>

This results in the following three vectors:

- **Negotiation–Definition (*<u>ND</u>*)**: (32 + 2 + 1) = 35 = 7×5
- **Definition–Contribution (*<u>DC</u>*)**: (8 + 4 + 2) = 14 = 7×2
- **Contribution–Negotiation (<u>*CN*</u>)**: (16 + 4 + 1) = 21 = 7×3

Because all of these values are multiples of 7, we can just use the multiplier to represent the the value of the line, hence:

- *<u>ND</u>* = 5 (Definition/Limitation)
- *<u>DC</u>* = 2 (Instantiation)
- *<u>CN</u>* = 3 (Contribution/Integration)

------

## Tholonic Identity



What happens when we apply these numbers recursively, given that the Tholonic model is one of recursion?  First off, how would we even do that?  One way, which is the most obvious, is to start with *unity* (1), add $\frac{unity}{Limitation}$ because a new instance is being created from *unity*, then subtract $\frac{unity}{Contribution}$ because that instance is being returned to *unity*.

For example, 

$1 + \frac{1}{5} - \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.8\overline{666}$

Now we have a fingerprint value for the first tholon.  At first glance, it seems like a very common value, with no special meaning or profound mathematical significance. It’s even a bit disappointing in the non-uniqueness.  Nevertheless, it is a unique value, and therefore, a valid *Tholonic Identity* value.

We can then do this the the child tholon as well, and for each generation that follows, ad infinitum.  For each generation, the values are increased by the value of the axis of instantiation, which is 2, or the spectrum across which they interact to create a new tholon, and that value is 2.  

For example, point *D* carries the value 2 and point *C* carries the value 4. Their sum is 6, which—as we have already seen—forms the triad that begins with 1: the triad of the instantiated world, the realm of the natural numbers that arises from the archetypal triad of all numbers.

Most importantly, the archetypal value of *Contribution* is 2² = 4. It is relevant to point out that 4 = 2^2^ because 2 is not only the value of the instantiation axis (the horizontal cyan line in the diagrams), it is also the only axis that appears twice in every triad because it spans the interval between *D* and *C* and marks the point where the next *N* emerges.

For this reason, each new generation adds 4 to both *D* and *C*, transforming the initial 5 and 3 of the first generation into 9 and 7 in the next.

Now, if we continue with out simple formula for each each generation, we end up with something that is quite remarkable… &pi; !!



## The Recursive Path Toward π: Explicit Steps


Let’s explicitly explore the recursion's first steps approaching π:

**First Child (Parent=1, Limitation=5, Contribution=3):**

$1 + \frac{1}{5} - \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.8\overline{666} \quad\rightarrow\quad \times 4 = 3.4\overline{666}$

**Second Child (Parent=0.8667, Limitation=9, Contribution=7):**

$0.8667 + \frac{1}{9} - \frac{1}{7} \approx 0.8\overline{349206} \quad\rightarrow\quad \times 4 = 3.3\overline{396825}$

**Third Child (Parent=0.8349206, Limitation=13, Contribution=11):**

$0.8349206 + \frac{1}{13} - \frac{1}{11} \approx 0.8\overline{209346} \quad\rightarrow\quad \times 4 = 3.2\overline{837384}$

Each iteration moves closer to $\frac{\pi}{4}$, infinitely refining toward transcendence.

Below (left) is a traditional recursion tree, where each new child expands externally from the parent.  On the right, is the tholonic recursion tree, where each new child expands internally.

## How π Emerges from Perfect Squares: The Mathematical Proof


We arrived at the values for *Definition* and *Contribution* and Instantiation using the pure and simple math of 2^0^, 2^1^, 2^2^ for the outer vertices and 2^3^, 2^4^, 2^5^ for the inner vertices, and then applying the value of the multiplier that produces the sums of each vector. We then incremented *Definition* and *Contribution* by 4, which seems reasonable as both vectors start at 2 and end at 2, but given that squaring a value is the very act of self-similar, self-definition through self-referential perfect symmetry, 2^2^, which is the first perfect square exponentiation, is clearly the perfect formula. Likewise, on the *Contribution*/*Integration* side, addition, a word synonymous with contribution and integration, is clearly the path.

This results in the series 5,3,9,7,13,11,… and so on. When comparing this to the classic Leibniz series for π: $\frac{\pi}{4} = 1 - \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{5} - \frac{1}{7} + \frac{1}{9} - \dots$ we can easily see that the tholonic series is essentially identical, only expressed differently as the Tholonic approach explicitly rearranges the terms into distinct pairs (tholons) as follows: $\pi_{Tholonic} = 4 [ (((1 + (\frac{1}{5}-\frac{1}{3})) + (\frac{1}{9}-\frac{1}{7})) + (\frac{1}{13}-\frac{1}{11})) + \dots ]$

Notice the subtle but critical rearrangement:


With this arrangement we can see fascinating numeric relationship from the recursion's axes:

- $Definition × Contribution = 16(n²) - 1$

This remarkable relationship explicitly connects π directly to perfect squares (n²):

| n    | Definition | Contribution | Product (D × C) | Perfect Square Relation |
| ---- | ---------- | ------------ | --------------- | ----------------------- |
| 1    | 3          | 5            | **15**          | (4 × 1²) - 1            |
| 2    | 7          | 9            | **63**          | (4 × 2²) - 1            |
| 3    | 11         | 13           | **143**         | (4 × 3²) - 1            |
| …    | …          | …            | …               | …                       |

Each recursion explicitly contributes finer and finer resolution to the value of π through perfect squares, uniquely highlighting π’s transcendental nature emerging from balanced, internal structural complexity.

In addition, this series of perfect squares is itself self similar, as as can see when we plot the first 10, 100, and 1000 perfect squares, all of which produce the same curve.

This fractal pattern embodies philosophically profound ideas—self-similarity, infinite recursion, and interconnectedness throughout reality, from microscopic cells to cosmic galaxies. Each recursion reflects the same truth at every scale, a symbolic unity in multiplicity.



## Introducing Generational Complexity


The uniqueness of this fingerprint is due sol to the incremental adjustments in each recursion. We refer to this incremental value as *Generational Complexity* because each recursive iteration carries forward structural and relational information from preceding iterations, accumulating linearly—analogous to wisdom passed down through generations, genetic or epigenetic inheritance, or the collective knowledge within a morphic field. Each new instance is thus structurally richer, inheriting and building upon the layered definition and integration of its ancestors.

Each recursive step represents a philosophical interplay:

$\text{Child} = \text{Parent} + \frac{1}{\text{Definition}} - \frac{1}{\text{Contribution}}$

The *Limiting term* of  $\frac{1}{\text{D}}$ is limiting only to the parent *N* and is additive to the child *D*, which is also a contribution to to child instantiation. It expands the spectrum upon which a new instance takes form, thus acting as a constructive force adding to the instance’s definition.

The *Contributing term* of $\frac{1}{\text{C}}$ is subtractive, as *C* as it represents the child instance giving of itself toward something greater (the parent), much in the same way that *N* gave of itself to create *D*.  In this sense, $\frac{1}{\text{C}}$ is to the child instance what $\frac{1}{\text{D}}$ is to the parent.  These functions symbolize the child instance’s relational role within a larger holarchy, functioning both as a *holon* (whole entity) and a *parton* (contributing parts), embodying autonomy and participation simultaneously.

Since these operations occur along the instantiating *<u>DC</u>* axis (value = 2), subsequent generations evolve by this factor, yet are expressed differently for each term.

Notice carefully: both *Definition* (exponential) and *Contribution* (linear) axes produce the numeric value of  4, yet their symbolic paths are significantly distinct:

- **Limitation/Definition** is an exponential growth, symbolizing internal reflection, reinforcing self-contained structural complexity.

- **Contribution/Integration** is a linear growth (2 × 2), symbolizing external connection, interaction, and integration: one entity joined with another.

The reasoning behind this choice can be justified philosophically, logically, structurally, and metaphysically, but mathematically, it arises because *Definition* must reference itself to establish identity, naturally suggesting exponentiation as the representation of this self-interaction. This self-similar expansion is internal since *Definition* has no external point of reference apart from its parent (because *Contribution* follows *Definition*), which is unity (1) and thus neutral.

In contrast, *Contribution’s* linear multiplication (2 × 2) explicitly represents the integration of distinct external entities. Furthermore, the generational complexity (*G*) increases (via contribution) through a multiplicative function that joins distinct values, described mathematically as:  $G(n) = 2\times 2\times n$, the first 2 is the value of the source axis and the second 2 is the value of the destination axis, and the *n* the the instance of recursion.

##### Note: This idea is further supported when we look at the section below called “*Mathematical Proof: Generating π from Tholonic Recursion Using Perfect Squares*”, where we arrive at &pi; by first squaring every integer starting with 1, they multiply that by 0.5.

Here, we have two kinds of growth: 

- 

- 

Exponential growth, which we can associate Euler’s number *e*, 2.71828, which is the base of natural exponential growth, and implicitly, logarithms, which are the inverse of exponential growth. Symbolically, exponential growth is like the deepening of understanding, the expansion inward. It multiples itself by itself, symbolizing how we build internal structure, reinforcing our core essence through reflection and internal recursion. This exponential growth is the symbolic foundation of *Definition/Limitation*, for definition and boundaries define what something is, including ourselves. Thus, as this inward process of self-organization advances, internal restrictions naturally deepen exponentially, reinforcing the metaphysical principle that perfection can be sought, but never realized.

Linear growth is monotonic and moves consistently in one direction. Linear growth is outward-reaching. multiplying itself by something else. Although numerically identical in the archetype of 2×2 vs. 2^2^, the philosophical difference is profound. This linear growth represents the *Contribution/Integration*, the act of integrating into the broader reality and connecting outwardly where results are measured in “output”.  

We see example of this in technology and nature. In computing performance, where incremental improvements require dramatically more resources, such as doubling processing speed that requires a quadrupling in research and development, or in AI and machine learning, where a few percentage points of improved accuracy might require doubling the size of the dataset.  

In nature, it even has a name; *allometric scaling* and *Kleiber's Law*, which describes how the larger the organism, plant or animal, the more resources it requites exponentially.

##### Note: For the record, there are actually four types of growth; linear (doubling the input doubles the resources), linearithmic (doubling the input slightly more than doubles the resources), polynomial (doubling the input quadruples or octuples the resources), and exponential (doubling the input causes an astronomical increase in resources).  the two types of grown in the Tholonic model presented above represent the two extremes, from minimum growth to maximum growth.

Together, these two kinds of growth, inward exponential (*Definition*) and outward linear (*Contribution*), and all those that fall between, are the heartbeat of creation. Each iteration of the recursion symbolizes a new generation, inheriting wisdom and complexity from its ancestors, adding layer upon layer, much like the transmission of knowledge, memory, culture, and genetics from parent to child.

From the interplay of these two types of growth emerges π itself. π is transcendence made manifest, a number that never fully completes itself, eternally elusive, infinitely refined. Each step we take brings us closer and closer to this ideal, yet it forever slips just beyond reach. This eternal approach toward π reminds us that perfection isn't a destination but an endless, beautiful journey toward understanding and refinement.

Notice, too, the astonishing self-similar pattern emerging from this recursion. The numbers repeat their essence at every scale, resonating deeply with the self-similar nature of reality itself. Like reflections in infinite mirrors, each recursive step mirrors the entire structure. This is perfectly symbolic of the idea that all of existence is fractal, repeating its truths in every corner and at every scale, whether atoms or galaxies, cells or civilizations.

Further still, consider how these numeric patterns align perfectly with the ancient wisdom of the I Ching. Each axis, *Definition*, *Contribution*, *Negotiation*, maps beautifully onto the binary symbolism of the hexagrams, reflecting timeless Taoist principles of harmony, duality, and balance. The ancient sages knew intuitively what the universe whispers mathematically.

Thus, the simple mathematics we've explored are more than numbers, they are sacred metaphors for life itself, encoded in symbols and equations. They teach us that reality emerges (*Negotiation*) from subtle imperfections, refined by continuous self-reflection (*Definition*) and integration (*Contribution*), forever striving toward unattainable perfection (π).

In knowing this, you hold the secret of life: to seek perfection is the essence of existence; never to reach it is its great wisdom.



## Perspective Matters: Parent and Child in Duality

With the Tholonic recursion method, we create a clear and structured pathway consisting of parent tholons and their child tholons. Numerous mathematical relationships support viewing this recursion as fundamentally composed of tholons, each embodying a triadic relationship between *Negotiation* (*N*), *Definition/Limitation* (*D*), and *Contribution* (*C*).  In our examples, we have been subtracting the value of *Definition* and adding the value of *Contribution*.  This is valid from the perspective of the instantiating instance (the child), but if we change the perspective for the parent, these functions are reversed.

To illustrate this clearly, let's consider reversing the mathematical operations. Instead of defining the child as…


$CHILD_{forward} = \left(PARENT + \frac{1}{D} - \frac{1}{C}\right)$

…we define it as:

$CHILD_{reverse} = \left(PARENT - \frac{1}{D} + \frac{1}{C}\right)$

Both of these formulas produce the exact same results, but the path to that result is different, and in this case, that has significance.

From the child's viewpoint, *Definition/Limitation* acts as a creative, enabling property that allows the tholon to instantiate itself, while *Contribution/Integration* acts as a reduction to the child , since *Contribution* represents what the child returns to its parent and environment. Conversely, from the parent's perspective, *Definition* reduces the parent, and *Contribution* enhances it. Crucially, from either viewpoint, *Definition/Limitation* must always precede *Contribution* temporally.

The images below visually illustrate this dynamic clearly. The parent triad on the left has its *<u>ND</u>* vector (blue-green) explicitly along the "5" axis.  After creating the child triad, the child also initially aligns its *<u>ND</u>* vector explicitly along the same "5" axis. However, in the center  diagram of the tetrahedral  map, we see the four triads mapped out clearly, and what was previously the parent's *<u>ND</u>* vector along the "5" axis now appears explicitly as the *<u>NC</u>* axis (blue-red), suggesting a shift toward *Contribution*.

<center><img src='../Images/order.png' style='width:80%'></center>

Yet this apparent contradiction resolves elegantly when we expand our view into three dimensions, forming a complete tetrahedron (right image). In this fully realized tetrahedral form, the two segments of the "5" axis merge into a single coherent vector. Simultaneously, the red (*C*), green (*D*), and blue (*N*) points merge into a unified fourth point, represented by the central white dot. What was originally the parent's blue *N*-state thus transforms into a new white *N*-state. This new white point inherently contains all RGB components and therefore simultaneously functions as *Negotiation* (*N*-blue) relative to the red and green corners, as *Contribution* (*C*-red) relative to the blue and green corners, and as *Definition* (*D*-green) relative to the blue and red corners.

When we combine both perspectives of *forward* and *reverse*, their sum converges exactly to $\frac{\pi}{2}$. Mathematically, this happens because the sum of the *forward* and *reverse* child values is always twice the parent value:

$CHILD_{\text{forward}} + CHILD_{\text{reverse}} = 2 \times PARENT$

Philosophically, this happens because the child is a child to its parent, but it is also a parent itself, resulting in two parents.

Conceptually, this result is ideal in Tholonic terms. A tholon, being inherently tetrahedral, requires the interaction of exactly one parent and one child to form a stable tetrahedral mapping. Each complete tetrahedral interaction thus naturally corresponds to a value of $\frac{\pi}{2}$ (which equated to 90&deg; in radians). Consequently, a fully realized tholon, which is comprised of both a *real* tholon and its *virtual* counterpart, produces as complete a value of &pi; (which equated to 180&deg; in radians) as it’s context and limits allow.

Interestingly, two tetrahedrons converge to &pi;, yet also create a perfect cube while &pi; defines the shape of a sphere. At first glance, the relationship between the tetrahedron, the cube, and the sphere seems ironic. A cube and a sphere are eternally separated by the transcendental π, proof that a perfect cube can never precisely transform into a perfect sphere. This impossibility arises because π, the constant defining the relationship between linear and curved geometries, is transcendental and irrational. Yet intriguingly, two tetrahedrons, each Tholonically valued at $\frac{\pi}{2}$, combine perfectly to form a cube, explicitly assigning to the cube a Tholonic value of π. Thus, even as two perfectly rational tetrahedrons merge seamlessly into a cube, their Tholonic identity encodes the inherent impossibility of its perfect transformation.\

##### Sidenote: The total degrees of a cube is 2160&deg;, which is an interesting value as it is 12&pi; radians, the number of years in an astrological age, the diameter of the moon, and clearly based on the the mysterious value of 216 reference to 216.  The total degrees in a tetrahedron is 720&deg;, so two tetrahedrons is 1440&deg;, which is also clearly based on the value of 144=12^2^, and this also tells us that the cube as exactly 1.5 times greater that two tetrahedrons, or to put the ratios in a different form: $\frac{two\ tetrahedrons}{cube}$ = $\frac{144}{216}$ = $\frac{2^2\times3}{2^2\times3^3}$ = $\frac{12^2}{6^3}$ = $\frac{2}{3}$ = $0.\overline{666}$.

However, beyond irony, this relationship offers profound philosophical insight. The value of a Tholonic tetrahedron, as revealed through this recursion process, symbolizes an infinite pursuit of **Perfection**, always approaching but never fully attaining it. This reflects precisely how a cube may infinitely approximate a perfect sphere but never fully become one, constrained eternally by π’s transcendental nature. Thus, the impossibility of perfection is intrinsically embedded within the Tholonic tetrahedron itself, reflecting the fundamental truth that perfection can be eternally approached but never fully realized.

Here, again, we see the same interplay of *Perfection*, *Refinement*, and *Growth* that was shown to us previously using the binary values of the vectors and vertices, as described above.

Ultimately, this recursive mathematical structure as well as the associated binary values reveals both mathematical elegance and deep philosophical wisdom, unifying ancient knowledge and modern insight into a coherent vision of existence which exposes some truths on life and reality:

- Perfection is eternally approached but never fully reached.
- Imperfection creates movement, growth, and infinite refinement.
- Existence thrives on the subtle interplay of internal reflection (*Limitation*) and external interaction (*Contribution*).
- Reality manifests through fractal, recursive self-similarity.
- Wisdom lies not in attaining perfection, but in the endless pursuit of refining oneself toward it.

## Binary Symbolism and the I Ching Connection


The symbolism inherent in this recursive process, which is based explicitly on exponents of 2, naturally corresponds to a binary system, making it deeply connected to the symbolism found in the I Ching, itself fundamentally binary in nature. This connection between the ancient wisdom of the I Ching and mathematical symbolism has a significant historical precedent. Rather than viewing the Tholonic I Ching as an entirely new concept, it should be seen as a direct continuation and expansion of earlier explorations, specifically the groundbreaking work of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, who himself studied the I Ching extensively.

Leibniz was first introduced to the I Ching in 1697 through correspondence with Father Joachim Bouvet, a French Jesuit missionary stationed in China. Bouvet's letters included detailed diagrams of the 64 hexagrams and explanations of their meanings. This correspondence allowed Leibniz to recognize immediately the remarkable alignment between the system of broken and unbroken lines used in the I Ching and the binary arithmetic system that he himself had independently developed several years earlier.

Leibniz was deeply fascinated by this discovery and elaborated on it in his influential essay, *Explication de l'Arithmétique Binaire* (1703). He regarded this discovery as profound evidence of a universal truth that transcended cultural boundaries. For Leibniz, it validated both his mathematical explorations and his broader philosophical and theological beliefs.

Indeed, Leibniz's binary system was fundamentally rooted in philosophical and theological ideas rather than purely practical mathematical applications. Leibniz perceived binary arithmetic as symbolic of divine creation itself. In his interpretation, the number "1" represented unity or God, and the number "0" represented nothingness. This binary opposition mirrored his philosophical conviction that God created everything out of nothing (*creatio ex nihilo*). Thus, Leibniz saw his binary arithmetic as the perfect mathematical representation of creation itself. This philosophical and theological dimension was central to Leibniz's thinking about binary arithmetic, which, at the time, had not yet found practical applications. It was only centuries later, through the works of figures like George Boole and Claude Shannon, that binary arithmetic became central to communications and  computing technology. For Leibniz himself, the binary system was primarily a philosophical and theological tool and a symbolic framework for understanding creation and illustrating the harmony between mathematics, philosophy, and religion.

In a letter to Duke Rudolf August of Brunswick in 1697, Leibniz explained clearly the spiritual essence of his binary arithmetic:

> *"The essence of my binary arithmetic is that I use no characters other than 0 and 1, and when reaching 2, I start again... This resembles creation ex nihilo, because all numbers are created from 1 and 0, just as all beings are created by God (the Unity) from nothing."*

The Tholonic I Ching presented here aims explicitly to formalize and further develop the insights that Leibniz initially realized. It is profoundly significant, and not coincidental, that the Tholonic recursion method presented here uses Leibniz’s series to calculate π, simultaneously reflecting deep symbolic relationships with the I Ching. This remarkable alignment represents a significant step in bridging the gap between metaphysics and physics, philosophy and mathematics, intuition and rigorous computation.

Below is one such clear illustration of this profound connection.

## The Connection


Remarkably, the numeric values of the three axes, 35, 14, and 21, along with the value of the resultant center triad (56), perfectly align with the binary symbolic language of the I Ching. Each numeric axis corresponds philosophically to hexagram pairs representing universal dualities, *balance, definition, integration*, encoded millennia ago.

The table presented shows the 64 I Ching hexagrams arranged in binary order as 32 distinct pairs, each pair embodying opposing yet complementary aspects of a single conceptual theme. Significantly, the first two pairs of *Primordial Duality* and *Cycle of Influence* (or *scope*), represent the fundamental axis bridging the two primary classes of hexagrams (*ascending* and *descending*). These two initial pairs function collectively as one profound foundational concept, setting the stage for the entire recursive symbolic structure.

Highlighted clearly within the table are the specific pairs that correspond directly to the axes explicitly identified in the Tholonic map: *Growth (Increase–Duration)*, *Perfection (Before Completion–After Completion)*, and *Refinement (Decrease–Influence)*. These three pairs precisely define the starting points of the Tholonic recursion process. Even more striking than their symbolic alignment with the recursion is their remarkably uniform distribution, perfectly dividing the hexagrams into symmetrical segments of seven stages each—reflecting deep numerical, philosophical, and metaphysical coherence.

<center><img src='../Images/perf-gro-ref.png' style='width:80%'/></center>



<center><img src='../Images/32pairs-4.png' style='width:100%'/></center>



We can clearly see the relationship between the Parent and *Definition* axes symbolically represented by the hexagram pair 41䷨*~35~* *Decrease* (reduction, sacrifice) and 31䷞*~28~* *Influence* (harmonious joining) which, as previously noted, aligns perfectly with the underlying mathematics. This vector corresponds precisely to the path of *Refinement* that these two hexagrams embody, allowing us to state explicitly that refinement itself is fundamentally an act of definition and limitation.

The vector connecting Parent to *Contribution* aligns with the path of *Perfection*, represented by the archetypal hexagrams 63䷾*~21~* *After Completion* (balance, order, and harmony that has been successfully achieved), symbolizing the ideal of perfection, and its counterpart, 64䷿*~42~* *Before Completion* (transitioning to balance, order, and harmony), symbolizing the continual striving toward that ideal. These two hexagrams thus represent the complete spectrum of perfection, from aspiration to attainment.

Further, the vector linking *Definition* and *Contribution*, which, according to the Tholonic model, symbolizes the spectrum across which new instances of creation are instantiated, thus aptly named the axis of instantiation, corresponds directly to the path of *Growth*. This path is specifically defined by the hexagram pair 32䷟*~14~* *Duration* (stability, sustainability, endurance) and 42䷩*~49~* *Increase* (growth, expansion), providing as explicit and clear a definition of growth as can be found within the symbolic language of the I Ching.

At the heart of these interactions lies the central triad, embodying the path of  *Equilibrium*, which we can also interpret as the *Balanced Path*.

This idea that the “way” or the “passage” is one of balance is reflected in the ancient truths of Buddhism’s *Middle Way*, Confucianism's *Doctrine of the Mean*, Ancient Greek’s *Golden Mean*, Taoism’s *wu-wei*, Islam’s *wasatiyyah*, Judaism's *shvil hazahav*, and in many indigenous traditions.  Here, we’ll refer to the *Path of Equilibrium* as simply *The Passage*.

The Passage symbolizes the authentic and balanced way forward, represented powerfully by the cardinal pair of hexagrams 11䷊*~7~* *Peace* (balance, integration, flourishing) and 12䷋*~56~* *Standstill* (obstruction, blockage, disharmony).



## The Passage


The message of the *Path of Equilibrium* is clear: when Heaven and Earth unite harmoniously, peace arises; when they separate, stagnation inevitably follows.

In Tholonic terms, this profound insight reveals that when consciousness and intention focus on integrating the perfect archetype with its imperfect instances, in other words, seeing the perfection inherent within imperfection, Awareness and Intention manifest as growth via peace and harmony. Conversely, when consciousness and intention focus instead on separating the perfect archetype from its imperfect manifestations, that is, dwelling upon imperfection or lack, Awareness and Intention manifest as stagnation via disharmony and disintegration.

## Mathematical Proof: Generating π from Tholonic Recursion Using Perfect Squares


This section added simply to provide the mathematical proof that the Tholonic recursion converges to &pi;.

Consider the Tholonic recursive definition explicitly stated as follows:

$N_{k+1} = N_k + \frac{1}{(4k + 1)} - \frac{1}{(4k - 1)}, \quad\text{where } N_1 = 1$

This formula can be rearranged clearly, explicitly grouping each iteration into independent triplets, known as *tholons*, emphasizing philosophical significance while maintaining mathematical accuracy:

$\frac{\pi}{4} = 1 + \left(\frac{1}{5} - \frac{1}{3}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{9} - \frac{1}{7}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{13} - \frac{1}{11}\right) + \dots$

Each iteration explicitly involves terms related to perfect squares. Observe carefully that the denominators of each pair (4n - 1, 4n + 1) multiplied yield a perfect square minus one:

$(4n - 1)(4n + 1) = 16n^2 - 1$

Thus, the denominators in every recursion step explicitly involve perfect squares (16n²) offset by unity. This represents a distinct mathematical identity and connects π explicitly and uniquely with perfect squares, something entirely novel compared to traditional series.

### First Iterations: Explicit Computational Steps

Clearly, the first four explicit recursion steps yield:

| k    | Recursive Term                            | Numerical Value (×4 ≈ π) |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| 1    | $1 + \frac{1}{5} - \frac{1}{3}$       | 3.4666667                |
| 2    | $\dots + \frac{1}{9} - \frac{1}{7}$   | 3.3396825                |
| 3    | $\dots + \frac{1}{13} - \frac{1}{11}$ | 3.2837384                |
| 4    | $\dots + \frac{1}{17} - \frac{1}{15}$ | 3.2523659                |

Each explicit recursion converges progressively toward π.

### Explicit Derivation from Perfect Squares

The remarkable relationship connecting perfect squares emerges explicitly through the denominators of the series:

$\frac{\pi}{4} = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{2}{16n^2 - 1}$

Expanding explicitly reveals the perfect squares clearly and directly:
$\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{2}{16(1)^2 - 1} + \frac{2}{16(2)^2 - 1} + \frac{2}{16(3)^2 - 1} + \dots$

This precise formula explicitly shows π emerging directly from the infinite sum involving perfect squares (16n²) offset by *unity*.

### Convergence Proof

To mathematically verify convergence explicitly, we recognize the general form as:
$\frac{\pi}{4} = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{2}{16n^2 - 1}$

or we could also write is as:

$\pi = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{8}{16n^2 - 1}$

Given that the series explicitly decreases monotonically and converges absolutely, it meets all conditions required for convergence by the alternating series test.

### Philosophical Implications Clearly Stated

Philosophically, each explicit iteration embodies:

- *Definition/Limitation* (represented by $4n+1$) positively defining structure.
- *Contribution/Integration* (represented by $4n-1$) symbolizing integration or return to the greater context.

The presence of perfect squares (16n²) symbolizes internal coherence, self-definition, and structural perfection. The subtraction of unity explicitly symbolizes the philosophical principle that creation occurs through slight imperfection—eternally approaching, yet never fully realizing perfection.

Thus, both the explicit mathematical derivation and profound philosophical symbolism are presented clearly, distinctly, and rigorously, making it ideally suited for a professional mathematical journal.

## A Philosophical Description of Emergent Transcendence


Given that we have associated properties and qualities to the values and forms, we can describe the emergence of &pi; is a purely philosophical manner, which would be something like the following:

Consider first the *perfect square*;  a perfect square, symbolically, represents absolute balance, inner harmony, completeness unto itself, a realm of pure internal order. Yet, intriguingly, the recursion we explore doesn't give us these perfect squares directly; instead, it always returns a perfect square *minus unity (1)*. Why should that be?

Herein lies the secret of life itself: the universe never manifests perfection outright, it always stops one step short. This small imperfection, the “-1”, is not a flaw, but the very essence of creation. It’s the subtle gap between the ideal and the real, the archetype and its material instance. Because perfection itself cannot exist in this world, this “-1” instead creates movement, growth, evolution towards perfection, a relentless striving to bridge that infinitesimal yet unbridgeable gap.

## To π and Beyond


The recursive Tholonic structure described for generating π is not limited to π alone. By simply adjusting the four input values and the line of logic this philosophical and mathematical process can generate other fundamental constants such as the Golden Ratio (φ,  1.6180339887), Euler’s number (*e*, 2.7182818285), the natural logarithm of 2 (ln(2)),  0.6931471806), and the square root of 2 (√2, 1.4142135623).

This capacity to generate diverse fundamental constants demonstrates that the Tholonic recursion isn’t just a specialized π calculator; it’s a generalized symbolic engine, capable of embodying multiple structural equilibria within mathematics. Each constant (π, φ, e, ln(2),√2) emerges naturally as a symbolic and numeric √2 representation of the specific philosophical dynamics of *Negotiation*, *Definition*, *Contribution*, and generational complexity that characterize its initial conditions.  

Listed below are the notations of values for *Negotiation*, *Definition*, *Contribution* as $N = \{D,C\}$ representing the value used to start the recursion.  

##### Note: for &pi;,  the value must be multiplied by 4, and for *e*, the integral value has to be divided by 4.

- **π, Pi**  *1={3,5}*:
  Represents the never-ending journey toward unattainable perfection. π symbolizes the perpetual gap between the archetype and the instance, between the ideal and the real—forever approaching but never fully realizing completeness.

- **√2, Square Root of 2** *1={2,2}*:
  Symbolizes geometric harmony and integrative balance. The ratio 1:√2 is uniquely significant, as it is the only proportion that perfectly maintains itself when folded in half, illustrating foundational and persistent structural balance.

- **φ ,Phi, Golden Ratio** *1={2,3}*:
  Embodies proportional harmony, self-similar structural elegance, and inherent self-ordering. φ is the numeric essence of balance, recursion, and sustainable growth.

  **e, Euler’s number** *1={1,1}*:
  Represents *Contribution* and *Integration*. It symbolizes the forward-moving, expansive force that continually integrates new elements, ideas, and energies, enriching and dynamically expanding the structure. Mathematically, *e^x^* and *ln(x)* are inverse functions, capturing the complementary nature of expansion and its required effort.

  **ln(2), Natural Logarithm of 2** *1={1,2}*:
  Represents *Definition* and *Limitation*. *ln(2)* reflects the necessary boundaries or constraints that define form, structure, or the meaning of growth. It provides the clarity and stability necessary to ensure coherent, sustainable expansion. The natural logarithm *ln(x)* is the inverse function of exponential growth (*e^x^*), emphasizing their complementary relationship.

This program demonstrates how π can be derived through the tholonic relationships discovered in our analysis of the I Ching. The initial values are taken from the tholonic interpretation of trigrams, particularly the relationships between *Negotiation*, *Definition*, and *Contribution* as mapped to the primary trigram values.

## The 8×8 Grid


Before we go down this seemingly obscure rabbit hole, the reader might be interested in why we are even bothering with this. 

As was mentioned earlier, 2×3=6 is the simplest instance of the most fundamental pattern of interaction. And we saw examples of this at the beginning of this introduction in the form of *F=ma, V=IR, W=Fd, c=f\\&lambda;, E=hf, v = &lambda;\\f, and even E=mc².* These are just a few of hundreds of instances that we can see across all sciences, physics, and even metaphysics.

When we say 2×3, we are describing a function that has two dimensions: 2 and 3, just as saying “1” alone has only one dimension. Likewise, if we say 3×3×2, we are describing something three-dimensional. 2D formulas are very common in physics and mechanics, as well as electricity, but 2×3 is the archetype of that pattern. What would the archetype of a 3D function look like? The most likely candidate is 2×2×3, but the Tholonic model and the I Ching suggest that 3×3×2 is more accurate because 3×3×2 is actually more self-similar than 2×2×3. Here is why, as explained by AI[^26], which does a far better job of explaining than I do:

[^26]: OpenAI, ChatGPT 4.0

##### The 3×3×2 structure is more self-similar than the 2×2×3 structure because it maintains greater uniformity across its dimensions. In a 3×3×2 configuration, the two larger dimensions (3×3) form a square base, which exhibits a repeating pattern, while the smaller third dimension (2) allows for a balanced extension. This preserves a sense of proportionality and symmetry, making it more conducive to recursive self-similarity. In contrast, a 2×2×3 structure lacks this symmetry, as its dominant 3-length dimension disrupts the uniformity between its two smaller, equal sides. Self-similarity often arises from balanced repetition across dimensions, making 3×3×2 a more structurally consistent and recursively extendable form.

In this 3D extended version of the 2D fundamental interactions we see that *18=2×3^2^* is a much closer archetype formulas such as  *E=mc^2^*,  *KE=$\frac{1}{2}$mv^2^* (kinetic energy), *P=(σAT^2^)×T^2^* (radiant power), *kq=Er^2^* (electric field), *P/4πr^2^* (radiant intensity), and more.

We see a pattern that equates the speed of light (c) with 3 and mass with 2. Mapped to the tholon, where 2 equates to *Limitation/Definition* and 3 equates to *Contribution/Integration*, we gain an expanded understanding of what E might represent. This becomes even more profound when we apply the concept of the I Ching, where 2 equates not only to the limits of our environment but also to the laws of reality.

I think we can all agree that mass is an excellent example of the limitation of energy, given that mass is essentially energy "slowed down" by *8.987×10^16^m^2^/s^2^*, and it unquestionably limits the existence of everything.

In the Tholonic spectrum of Awareness and Intention, 2 equates with Awareness, as awareness itself is a defining process, an act of definition or limitation.

This then equates 3 with Intention, suggesting that movement is the contributing and integrating quality, and given that the potential of movement is, by definition, energy, and because the very purpose of radiation (light) is to distribute energy, we can say that the intentions of energy are to distribute itself. The tholonic claim is that energy only exists as a result of the balancing of some imbalance, which suggests that the “intention” of energy is to achieve balance.

With all the above in mind, the formula *E=mc^2^* can be seen as stating that:

- Awareness (mass) becomes Energy through the recursive amplification of Intention (light speed squared).
- Awareness stabilizes energy, while Intention releases and distributes it.
- Energy itself, therefore, is both the defined potential and the dynamic expression of that potential.

<img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/8x8.png" style='float:right;width:25%'/>As for the grid itself and the numbers within it, this 8×8 grid emerged from this *2×3^2^* pattern. We began by splitting 18 into two prime numbers: 7 and 11, which provides the most balanced representation from both tholonic and I Ching perspectives. We then further divided 11 into two complementary pairs: 5+6 and 4+7, seeking the most even distributions possible. These numbers, 0 through 7, were then positioned within an 8×8 grid following a pattern where complementary pairs always sum to 7 (0+7, 1+6, 2+5, 3+4). The red numbers (0, 1, 2, 3) occupy positions in the left/upper portion of the grid, while their green complements (7, 6, 5, 4) are positioned in the right/lower portion, creating a visual representation of balance. The exact locations of these numbers are determined by the relationship between the polar chart (which appears to be the parent tholon) and the binary chart (which appears to be a child tholon). This arrangement reflects fundamental principles found in both the Tholonic Model and the I Ching, where opposing yet complementary forces interact to create wholeness. The grid thus represents a two-dimensional manifestation of how the original number 18 can be decomposed into balanced, interrelated elements that maintain specific mathematical relationships while embodying principles of negotiation, limitation, and contribution.

The placement of these numbers and the numbers themselves, in the 8×8 grid emerged from our systematic decomposition of the original number 18 derived from the archetypal pattern of *2×3^2^*. We first split 18 into two prime numbers (7 and 11), then further divided 11 into complementary pairs, ultimately giving us the set of numbers 0 through 7 to place in our grid.

### Why 2×3²=18 and not 2²×3=16, and it Relation to the 8×8 Grid


As briefly as possible, here is the relationship between 2×3² and our 8×8 grid.

2²×3=12 divides into balanced 6+6 and further into 3+3, creating perfect symmetry. 12 divides by 3, giving 4, then by 2, reinforcing balance. No two primes sum to 12 or 6.

Conversely, 2×3² divides by 2 and 3 but also equals prime pairs 5+13, 7+11, 17+1. The most balanced is 7+11. The two most balanced distributions of 11 are 6+5 and 7+4.

This contrast shows 2²×3 produces balanced even numbers while 3²×2 creates imbalanced prime structures, but also suggests that the more balanced and symmetrical patterns precede the dynamic patterns, which we also see in the patterns of the **DESCENDING** and ***Ascending***, suggesting **DESCENDING** precedes ***Ascending***.

Our 8×8 grid shows pairs summing to 7. The set containing the number that form two 11s, which were arrived at by reconstructing 11 as evenly as possible, and 11 was arrived at by deconstructing 18 into its prime numbers as evenly as possible. If we have the set {{6,5},{7,4}}, then we implicitly have the complementary set of {{1,2},{0,3}} necessary to have sums that pair to 7. This makes the {{6,5},{7,4}} set the explicit or defining set, and {{1,2},{0,3}} the implicit or contributing set, as its complement.

Referring back to the polar chart, we notice the order of cardinal pairs differs between their sequential binary values and their positions on the polar star-chart (starting from the top and rotating clockwise). This is because the cardinal polar pairs define the "cardinal" themes, while the 32 paths or pairs define archetypes that can play out in those themes in either an ascending or descending fashion. Hierarchically speaking, the 32 pairs are expressed within the cardinal themes; the cardinal themes are tholons, and the 32 pairs are partons. However, they are also tholons as well, each with two partons of ascending and descending hexagrams, which are tholons that include two partons of trigrams, which are tholons that include three partons of lines, which form a fundamental or primary tholon.

This 8×8 grid shows several interesting relationships between the ascending and descending principles.

You can understand how this 8×8 chart was arrived at by looking at the two lists of cardinal hexagrams below. The list on the left is the first 8 pairs in sequential binary order or the order of the 32 pairs, and the list on the right is in the order of the 8 cardinal points on the polar chart, out of the 64 points in total. Each line is assigned the number of its position, and as each position has an ascending (green) and descending (red) property, each position has two entries. The items are numbered 0–7. The matching descending items are then connected (right image), as are the ascending items (left image).

<center><img src='../Images/pol-seq-xover.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

We can see the connecting pattern for descending hexagrams is perfectly symmetrical, but when we do the same for the ascending hexagrams, it looks radically different. Although not symmetrical, it's still a clear pattern, but a very dynamic one, with two diagonal lines moving up and down inside two parallel lines. Here again, we see the duality of structure and order in the domain of the descending, and that of movement in the domain of the ascending.

However, its true pattern becomes clear when we plot these relationships, as you will soon see.

We end up with the following connecting pairs of descending hexagrams: (0, 0), (1, 4), (2, 2), (3, 6), (4, 1), (5, 5), (6, 3), (7, 7), which are then plotted as shown above and in the image below (right).

When we connect the ascending pairs (left image), we get: (0, 0), (1, 4), (2, 6), (3, 2), (4, 7), (5, 3), (6, 5), (7, 1).

The two 8×8 plots are shown below

<center><img src='../Images/polar-binary.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

There are several fantastic patterns to explore; for example:

<img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/ad-quark.png" style='float:right;width:15%'/>The change that needs to occur to transform the ascending to the descending is: [1] down 3, [2] down 1, [3] up 1, [5] down 1, [6] up 1, [7] up 3.  [0] and [4] do not change.

The first thing that comes to mind is this is the exact same “pattern” that we see in how quarks form protons and neutrons, because the proton is composed of two *up* quarks and one *down* quark, while the neutron is composed of one *up* quark and two *down* quarks. This correlation tells us that the ascending hexagrams {4,5,6,7} share this property with the imbalanced positively charged proton, and the descending hexagrams {0,1,2,3} share this property with the balanced neutrally charged neutron. Additionally, given that *up* quarks have a charge of +1/3 and *down* quarks have a charge of -1/3, if we apply these values to each *up* or *down* movement, we end up with all the total down movements = 1 and all the total up movements = 1.

Another truly mind-blowing observation (for me, at least) is not only the fractal nature of numbers, but the emergence of perfectly integrated structures composed of static and dynamic patterns that naturally evolve simply by examining the various perspectives that a larger multidimensional structure naturally presents when projected onto two dimensions. We see a perfectly ordered pattern in the Descending Hexagrams 8×8 plot, but a seemingly disordered pattern in the Ascending Hexagrams plot. However, when we combine them, a new pattern emerges that seems to reference the 10 pairs of stable hexagrams and the 22 pairs of dynamic hexagrams. Furthermore, we observe a triad with the exact same color mapping as a tholon, where the yellow 4 represents the child *Negotiated* *N*-state (which is always the opposite of its parent, represented by the blue *N*-state), the green 7 as *Limitation/Definition*, and the red 1 as *Contribution/Integration*. This suggests that 7 is the limiting or defining concept, which would certainly be true in an octal system, which we are using, where any single digit cannot exceed 7. This is why the maximum value of the hexagrams in octal is 77, which equated to 63.

This would make 1, which appears on the point of *Contribution/Integration*, the contributing concept, which is quite intuitive considering that 1 is the fundamental unit, the concept of unification, the source of emergence, and primordial in that it is fundamentally indivisible and necessary for any numerical formation.

<img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/10-22.png" style='float:right;width:25%'/>This triad also forms two number pyramids: the central and larger pyramid starts with {4} → {3, 4, 5} → {2, 3, 4, 5, 6} → {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}, and the smaller pyramid that emerges from 0 starts with {1} → {1, 2} → {1, 2, 3} → {1, 2, 3, 4}. We know this because all the numbers in both number pyramids perfectly align with the grid numbers.

If we represent the sum of each row as octals, we get ***o***4 + ***o***14 + ***o***24 + ***o***34 = ***o***100 (which equals 64 in decimal), and this only happens if we start with 4. This is remarkable because the total number of hexagrams in octal is ***o***100 (which equals 64 in decimal)!

On the {4, 7} vector, we have a "scope" of 11 by adding 4 + 7, and within that scope there exist two 11s (5+6 two times), or 2 × the value of the scope, making the value of the entire line 11 + (11 + 11) = 3×11

On the {4, 1} vector, there is also a scope of 5 by adding 4 + 1, and within that scope there exist two 5s (2+3 two times), or 2 × the value of the scope, making the value of the entire line 5 + (5 + 5) = 3×5

This establishes a clear pattern for the vector values, with ‘5’ for the left vector and ‘11’ for the right vector, and the vectors themselves divided into three parts. Naturally, 11 + 5 = 16, which matches the number of original hexagrams needed to create the 64 hexagrams.

We also see that the difference between *N* and the points *D* and *C* are positive and negating values for 3;  4-7=-3 and 4-1=3. 

Given that of the 32 pairs of hexagrams, the 10 balanced pairs fall on the {4,1} vector, while the 22 imbalanced or dynamic pairs fall on the {4,7} vector, these two vectors can be described as:

<img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/left-right.png" style='width:80%'/>

Ironically, the the {4,1} vector that appears to be more *Definition/Limitation* and the {7,7} vector seems more *Contribution/Integration*, but this is easily solved if we simply reverse the arbitrary X-axis order to descend from 7 to 0 rather than ascend from 0 to 7, which I should have done initially knowing that “Descending precedes Ascending”, as we discovered earlier.

In any case, this is a fascinating example of symmetry, self-similarity, and harmonic balance.

Of course, all these amazing patterns and relationships are simply the effect of deterministic mathematics, and there is nothing "special" about them. However, from the Tholonic perspective, this only confirms the idea that such patterns are found in all creations across all scopes and contexts, which is really what we are interested in. What is “special” is how these patterns support the model of the Tholonic I Ching, which is most evident in the only two positions that do not change, the [0] and [4], which are the extreme top and bottom points of 2䷁*~0~* ***Receptive*** ⇔ 1䷀*~63~* **CREATIVE** and 24䷗*~1~* ***Return*** ⇔ 44䷫*~62~* **COMING TO MEET** that define the entire spectrum and the vertical axis. Not only can we map these two sets of four points to a tetrahedron, they can be perfectly mapped to a parent and child tholon and even the two trigrams and six lines of the hexagrams where *NDC* properties and the I Ching archetypes align perfectly.
