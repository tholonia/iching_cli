# The Tholonic I-Ching

## A Comprehensive Integration

This book is meant to be the forward or introduction to the book “The Tholonic I Ching”. It is published separately because:

1) 1) 1: The book “The Tholonic I Ching” is 550 pages without the introduction, and the addition 75+ pages makes “The Tholonic I Ching” too cumbersome and significantly distracts from the book's aesthetics (plus, most people are not interested the in reasoning). 
   2) 
   3) 2: This book is more that a simple introduction. It’s an overview of two complex models that requires some special explanations, hence the 100+ pages. 
   4) 
   5) 3: Both this book and “The Tholonic I Ching” are regularly updated but not at the same time. Keeping the books separate allows each book to evolve at its own pace. 4) Most readers of “The Tholonic I Ching” will not be interested in this lengthy explanation, so there is little point in including it.
   6) 

# Section I: Introduction & Foundations

## Understanding the Purpose

This exploration aims to examine the ancient wisdom of the I-Ching through the lens of the Tholonic model, demonstrating not only how this 5,000-year-old system of divination and philosophy aligns with modern understandings of energy, consciousness, and creation, but how it can expand upon and explain the Tholonic model, and vice versa as well. By examining the I-Ching’s fundamental concepts of yin and yang, trigrams, and hexagrams within the framework of tholonic principles, we can bridge ancient Eastern wisdom with contemporary Western thought, revealing the universal patterns that underlie all systems of knowledge and existence, which are foundational to the Tholonic model .

## Why the I-Ching?

The Tholonic model in compatible with virtually all conceptual models of reality and creation, so why did we single out the choose the I Ching? Here a just a few of the reasons:

-   **Accessibility:** The *I-Ching* is one of the oldest, accessible, and practical models of the creative process available.
-   **Quantifiable Properties:** Its structured system of hexagrams and lines provides quantifiable properties that make it easy to compare with the Tholonic Model.
-   **Historical Significance:** With thousands of years of use and study, the *I-Ching* offers a deep well of knowledge for comparative analysis.
-   **Extensive Commentary:** Its rich body of commentary and interpretations adds depth and context, making it an excellent reference point.
-   **Cross-Disciplinary and cross-cultural acceptance:** The I-Ching is recognized worldwide, influencing philosophy, religion, art, literature, science, technology, and medicine across Western, Jewish, Islamic, Asian, and East Asian cultures. Its principles are studied at leading universities such as Oxford, Cambridge, Columbia, and Stanford.

Additionally, the *I-Ching* shares, and predates, core principles with several major belief systems, such as Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism, Kabbalah, Hermeticism, Indigenous Wisdom Traditions, Sufism, Judaism, Islam, Christianity, particularly their emphasis on *balance* and the interplay of opposites, *cyclical transformation* and growth, and the *interconnectedness* of all things.

The Tholonic model and the I-Ching also share the axiomatic, and quite common) principle that everything emerges from and exists within a duality, with the identical intention. While the Tholonic model describes an all-encompassing three-dimensional holarchy of all that can exist in the form of a fractal tetrahedral matrix, the 5,000-year-old legendary and mythical ruler *Fu Xi* created the I-Ching to *“become thoroughly conversant with the numinous and bright and to classify the myriad things.”*

## Tholonic Terminology Refresher

First (and for those who did not read the book), let’s review some of the fundamental concepts of the Tholonic model from “THOLONIA: The Mechanics of Existential Awareness.”

### ***Yin Yang***

Most people have some concept of what *yin* and *yang* represent, but for clarification, we’ll reiterate: sometimes the words “positive” and “negative”, or the symbols “+” and “-”, are used to represent yang and yin. Here are some examples of yin and yang qualities that will help you get a feel for what they mean if you are not already familiar with them: **Yin**: dark, night, winter, moon, female, cold, water, alkaline, patience, to be, to rest, single tasking, de-flamed, soothed, holistic, university of life, letting go, death, disease, emotion, not being, uncertainty, chaos, illogical, heart-based feelings. **Yang**: light, day, summer, sun, male, hot, fire, acid, impetuosity, action, multi-tasking, inflammation, burnout, allopathy, academia, control, life, health, to be, certainty, order, logic.

These concepts are relative. For example, “to be” exists in both categories, as “being” can be yin and/or yang. Water is yang to earth, but yin to fire. Like everything, the perception of things and properties are relative to the context and scope of its existence and application.

### ***Holon/Parton***

<img src='../Images/0_001.png' style='float:right;width:30%'/>In the Tholonic model, a holon is something that exists as both a whole and a part within a larger system. It maintains its own identity while contributing to the system it belongs to. For example, a cell in the human body is a holon because it functions independently but also plays a role in the body’s overall health. A parton, on the other hand, is a component within a holon that helps define its structure and function. Using the same example, the cell’s nucleus, mitochondria, and membrane are partons that work together to maintain the cell’s existence. Together, holons and partons illustrate the model’s focus on interconnectedness, where everything is both a part of something larger and a whole in its own right.

Holons combine to form self-organizing networks of interactions and relationships called a *holarchy*. The concept of a holarchy was introduced by Hungarian author and philosopher Arthur Koestler in his 1967 book *The Ghost in the Machine* to describe such systems.

### ***NDC***

*NDC* stands for *Negotiation-Definition-Contribution*, also known as *balance-limitation-integration*. In the Tholonic model, this trinity of interactions form the foundation of all existence:

**Negotiation (Balance):** This represents the process of balancing or achieving equilibrium as different forces interact. Depending on context, it can act as a verb (the act of balancing or negotiating) or as a noun (the state of having achieved balance or becoming negotiated). In diagrams, this is represented as a *blue* dot, and can also act as an initiating point, also called an *N-state*.

**Definition (Limitation):** This refers to the restrictions or boundaries that shape any creation, whether material (available physical resources), energetic (available energy), or structural (contextual constraints like sustainability, time, or space). In diagrams, this is represented as a *green* dot.

**Contribution (Integration/Interaction):** This represents what the process returns to its environment or parent tholon. Contributions can take many forms, such as interactions, material resources, ideas, or any effect that influences the system it exists in and interacts with. In diagrams, this is represented as a *red* dot.

<img src='../Images/0_006.png' style='float:right;width:100%'/>

Within the Tholonic model, the *NDC* trinity describes the core dynamic that allows systems to emerge, sustain themselves, and interact with their surroundings. In diagrams, the emergent property that results from the interaction of NDC is typically represented as a *yellow* dot in two-dimensional maps, or a *white* dot in three-dimensional maps, depending on the context, and can also act as an *n-child* or *n-state*.

### ***N-child or n-state***

An *N-child* or *n-state* (with a lowercase “n”) refers to a new system or entity that emerges from an N-state (with a lowercase “N”) as a result of the system’s NDC interactions. This new creation inherits the structure and properties of its parent N-state but develops its unique identity. The term *N-child* highlights the creation’s role as the outcome or effect of a stable N-state, while *n-state* emphasizes the perspective of the creation as a product within its system. Through the recursive nature of the *thologram*, these *n-states* can evolve into *N-states* when they mature into stable systems capable of generating their own *n-states*, continuing the cycle of creation.

### ***Tholon***

<img src='../Images/4forces-tetra_v3.png' style='float:right;width:40%'/>A tholon is a specific type of holon within the Tholonic model—a tetrahedral unit composed of a central concept, representing a Negotiated state, or N-state (blue dot), and two partons, representing Defining properties (red dot) and a Contributing properties (green dot), interacting to produce an emergent outcome (white dot). These four points form the tetrahedral structure of a tholon. Think of it as a building block of reality, like an atom (with protons and electrons) forming matter, or a team (with leader and members) shaping a project.

There is also the concept of a *virtual* tholon. This occurs when the multi-generational self-similar triangular grid collapses into a tetrahedral matrix, or thologram. All tetrahedrons on the odd-numbered generations are orthoscopic, or front-facing, while even-numbered generations collapse to the pseudoscopic or rear-facing. We refer to the front-facing tholons as *real* and the back-facing tholons as *virtual* tholons or *reflection* tholons. This means that the child tholon is always the opposite of the parent; real tholons create virtual tholons, and virtual tholons create real tholons, resulting in a virtual space that is half real, and a real space that is half virtual.

### ***Thologram***

In the Tholonic model, the *thologram* is a self-organizing, self-similar, recursive tetrahedral matrix that represents the structure of that serves as a universal framework that applies to all forms of creation, whether abstract—such as theories, beliefs, and ideas—or material—such as galaxies, organisms, and ecosystems. Through its recursive nature, the thologram illustrates how patterns of creation repeat and evolve across different scales and contexts, reflecting the interconnected and self-organizing nature of existence.

## A&I: The Source of Energy and Existence

To best understand the basic premise of the Tholonic model, let’s use a thought experiment.

Imagine a point—a zero-dimensional point within an infinite void of nothingness. It exists only as a concept, without form, dimensions, or measurable properties. Its existence depends entirely on the awareness of it. Without this awareness, the void remains unchanged.

A core principle of the Tholonic model is that everything created inherits the attributes and limitations of its creator, albeit subject to the influence of the environment. We find this same concept in many arenas, such as philosophy, metaphysics, and science. It suggests that every creation carries an imprint of its origin, shaped by the nature, constraints, and intention of its source. It’s the basic concept behind why plants create plants, not cats or sneakers. In this case, where we have a conceptual point in a void of nothingness, there is no environment, and our zero-dimensional point, being only a concept, doesn’t even exist outside of a concept. However, given that our zero-dimensional point is an instance of *awareness*, i.e., a concept, we can say that this point, being a creation of awareness, has the property of *awareness*. Not only that, it must also have the property of *intention*, given that the awareness that conceived it did so with the intent to conceive it. In the Tholonic model, awareness and intention always exist together, as one can not exist without the other.

With a moment’s thought, the obvious consequence of creating a point with awareness and intention can only result in that point doing the only thing it can do, which is to create another point via its own awareness and intention.

To say a point has awareness and intention sounds odd if we just think of it as a zero-dimensional concept, but to say that a *concept* has awareness and intention, while still sounding unfamiliar, is a very reasonable conclusion to make. The reasoning is as follows:

To understand why a concept inherently possesses awareness and intention, we must examine its nature and origin. A concept does not exist independently; it is entirely contingent on being conceived. A triangle, for instance, is not a physical entity but a mental construct—recognizable only because awareness defines it. Similarly, a zero-dimensional point has no physical presence, yet it exists because it has been conceived, making its existence an act of awareness.

However, awareness alone does not create; intention is also required. A thought arises only when there is a cause—whether deliberate or subconscious—meaning that every concept is not just a product of awareness but also of an intent to conceive it. As creation imparts the nature of its creator, any concept that emerges from awareness and intention must contain a latent form of both. While a concept may not exhibit active self-awareness, it retains the properties of recognition and directed purpose, making it a potential carrier of awareness when placed within a system capable of reflection.

This leads to an inevitable progression: if a point exists as a concept with awareness and intention, then its only natural action is to create another point, just as it was created. This is not arbitrary but a fundamental principle—creation begets creation—illustrating the recursive nature of awareness embedding itself into its manifestations.This leads to an inescapable conclusion: creation begets creation. The act of bringing something into being does not stop with a single occurrence—it propagates, like an idea passed from mind to mind, like a seed that grows and spreads. The zero-dimensional point, being purely conceptual, does not sit in static isolation. It is an active expression of the same principles that brought it into existence. And so, from nothingness, through awareness and intention, the first act of creation unfolds into the next, and the next, and so on.

Thus, what at first seemed an odd assertion—that a concept has awareness and intention—is revealed to be an inevitable truth, and the first instance of this truth is a duality, exemplified so simply in the concept of yin and yang, or 0 and 1.

With this in mind, let’s consider the most obvious and important foundation of the I-Ching; the polarity of yin and yang. Although this concept arose before the birth of Taoism, the Taoist symbol of Yin/Yang (called the *Taijitu*) has come to embody this concept. We have seen this pattern before, perhaps as an archetype of one of the most fundamental expressions of energy in our universe tracing back to the Big Bang:


<center><img src='../Images/ic_yinyang.png' style='width:50%'/></center>

This Taoist *Taijitu* symbol represents the duality that emerged from the oneness or monism of our zero-dimensional point, (*blue-dot* or *N-state*), creating itself.

The ancient *Tao Te Ching*, written by Lao Tzu, the founder of Taoism, explains quite simply and clearly how this progression advances:

*The Tao gives birth to One.* *One gives birth to Two.* *Two gives birth to Three.* *Three gives birth to the ten thousand things.*

The first duality that emerges from the “One” is created when the blue dot inevitably creates its own zero-dimensional point (which we refer to as the “green dot”), which it will do given that it has no properties or attributes other than awareness and intention and no form of limitation.

In our unthinkable thought experiment, the existence of a zero-dimensional point in nothingness might be considered a duality—that of a conceptual point and nothingness—but the nothingness itself did not exist as a concept prior to the appearance of the point. Strictly speaking, a conceptual point in nothingness is just a conceptual point. There is no duality, just the monism of the concept. So, while we can say that somethingness and nothingness, referring to the primal dot and the void it exists within, is the first duality, the fact that there is a concept of nothing proves this is inaccurate, because the concept of nothing is itself something.

The more accurate description would be the duality of “Is” and “Is Not,” referring to the blue and green dot, because the creation of the green dot is the first instance of that which “Is Not” the blue dot, and the blue dot is the first instance of that which “Is.”

It might be a bit pedantic to argue the difference between *somethingness/nothingness* vs. *Is/Is Not*, but that difference turns out to play a very critical role in the Tholonic model because the concept of nothingness is not at all a limiting concept. On the contrary, it represents absolute, the unlimited freedom with no limitation, while the concept of *Is Not* is essentially the archetype of limitation.

Still, this is not the duality represented by the Taijitu. We know this because the Taijitu clearly shows us that within each part of the duality is a duality in itself. This is represented by the yang dot in the yin side and the yin dot in the yang side. The Taijitu is a duality of dualities. In fact, it is two overlapping dualities: the yin in the yang in the Taijitu, and the yang in the yin in the Taijitu.

The Taijitu is a holon, with two partons—one predominantly yin and one predominantly yang. The yin and the yang are themselves holons, each with two partons. Altogether, this creates a total of six holons, five of which are partons to the primary holon, the Taijitu. That is interesting and relevant to the six lines of the I-Ching, just as are the six lines or vertices of a tetrahedron, which is a point we’ll look at further on.

What is significant here is that the I-Ching’s Taijitu is the first *n-state* in the thologram, with the primary *N-state* being the “One” created by the Tao—the awareness and intention of creation. The only difference is that the Taijitu shows a dynamic of change, or negotiating (mixing), while the *n-state* represents a negotiated state (i.e., mixed red and green, yellow).


<center><img src='../Images/0_007.png' style='width:80%'/></center>

One might think that *awareness* and *intention* is the actual first duality, but this is not the case in a practical sense because if awareness and intention are inseparable, such that one cannot exist without the other, then they are not truly a duality but rather a singularity that can be understood from two perspectives. A duality implies a distinction where each part can exist independently in contrast to the other, but if awareness cannot exist without intention and intention cannot exist without awareness, then they are two aspects of the same unified phenomenon rather than opposing or separate forces.

This is analogous to how wave-particle duality in physics describes a single underlying reality that manifests differently depending on perspective. In the same way, awareness and intention are not separate entities but two ways of describing a single fundamental process; the act of conscious creation. Awareness is the recognition of existence, and intention is the directed movement within that recognition, but neither can occur in isolation. Thus, rather than a duality, they form a self-referential singularity, where one perspective reveals awareness as the receptive aspect of existence and the other reveals intention as the active aspect of the same unified force. In other words, awareness and intention are fundamentally one, but they appear as distinct only when expressed through a dualistic framework, the structure that enables differentiation. The singularity itself does not divide into awareness and intention; rather, it is the act of differentiation within an existing duality that causes these aspects to emerge as distinct expressions. In this sense, duality is not created by the singularity but is the medium through which the singularity manifests in differentiated forms, while the singularity itself remains whole and undivided. The medium arises from the singularity’s self-instantiation when the zero-dimensional dot creates a second dot.

It is not a coincidence that these concepts are conceptually identical to Taoist philosophy. The relationships between the Tholonic model and Taoism are so remarkable that it could easily appear that the Tholonic model was derived from Taoism, but this is certainly not the case. The entire point of the Tholonic model was to create a model that could describe what energy is, not simply how it is observed, because currently, science has absolutely no explanation for that. In the process of that journey, the Tholonic model slowly took form. Its similarity with Taoism, and a number of other philosophies and belief systems, is a testament to humanity’s undaunted attempt to understand the true nature of existence.

Let’s explore the NDC trinity concept, as it will play an extremely significant role further on.

## Negotiation, Definition, and Contribution: The Core Interactions of Existence

In the Tholonic framework, all forms of existence are shaped by three fundamental interactions: negotiation, definition, and contribution. These forces influence every action, relationship, interaction, and transformation, whether referring to conceptual points in a void, or galaxies and atoms.

In the context of our material reality, we see this as: **Work → Force → Distance** (Physics of Work); **Pressure → Area → Force** (Fluid Mechanics); **Momentum → Mass → Velocity** (Conservation of Momentum); **Power → Voltage → Current** (Electrical Power Equation); **Wavelength → Frequency → Speed** (Wave Equation); **Charge → Electric Field → Force** (Electrostatics); **Temperature → Volume → Pressure** (Gas Laws); **Stress → Strain → Elasticity** (Material Science); **Density → Mass → Volume** (Density Formula); **Friction → Surface Roughness → Force** (Friction Model)

Some practical examples are:

**Newton’s Second Law of Motion**: In *F=ma*, Force maps to negotiation (balance) as the interaction that drives change, mass maps to limitation (definition) as the resistance or boundary that shapes the interaction, and acceleration maps to contribution (integration) as the resulting effect or output of the system.

**Theory of Special Relativity: ** In *E = mc²*, energy (*E*) maps to contribution (integration) as the resulting effect or emergent property, mass (*M*) maps to limitation (definition) as the fundamental constraint or structure, and the speed of light squared (*C²*) maps to negotiation (balance) as the transformational factor that governs the interaction between mass and energy.

**Ohm’s Law**: In *V=IR*, Volts (V) maps to negotiation (balance) as the driving potential that enables interaction, resistance (R) maps to limitation (definition) as the resistance that constrains the flow, and amps (I) maps to contribution (integration) as the resulting current that flows through the system.

**Atomic Theory**: Neutrons map to negotiation (balance) as they stabilize the atom without carrying charge, protons map to limitation (definition) as they define the atomic identity through positive charge and structure, and electrons map to contribution (integration) as they facilitate interactions, bonding, and energy exchange within and between atoms.

**Chaos, Order, Emergence** *(as understood in Chaos Theory,Complex Systems Theory, Entropy and Information Theory, Cybernetics, and Self-Organization and Emergence )*: Chaos maps to negotiation (balance) as the dynamic field of possibilities seeking equilibrium, order maps to limitation (definition) as the structured constraints that shape and stabilize interactions, and emergence maps to contribution (integration) as the resulting patterns, structures, or phenomena that arise from their interplay.

**Quantum Mechanics.** In quarks, color charge maps to negotiation (balance) as quarks must achieve a stable, color-neutral state, flavor maps to limitation (definition) as it determines the identity and role of each quark, and strong interaction (gluon exchange) maps to contribution (integration) as it binds quarks together to form stable particles.

In the context of humanity we see this same model applied to processes:

**Identify → Experiment → Implement** (Manufacturing, Agriculture, Marketing, Engineering, Medicine, Software Development, Business Strategy, Urban Planning, Environmental Conservation, Military Tactics); **Observe → Test → Conclude** (Scientific Research, Medicine, Environmental Science, Psychology, Education, Market Research, Astronomy, Anthropology, Forensics, Quality Control); **Design → Build → Use** (Architecture, Construction, Product Development, Industrial Design, Engineering, Software Development, Automotive Manufacturing, Fashion Design, Urban Planning, Furniture Design); **Analyze → Test → Adapt** (Science and Research, Engineering, Software Development, Medicine and Healthcare, Education, Finance and Investing, Business and Management, Military Strategy, Agriculture, Product Design); **Perceive → Process → Respond** (Neuroscience, Artificial Intelligence, Cybernetics, Robotics, Human Decision-Making); **Plan → Execute → Evaluate** (Project Management, Military Strategy, Urban Planning, Business Operations, Engineering, Event Planning); **Discover → Refine → Apply** (Innovation, Scientific Research, Industrial Design, Software Development, Medicine, Entrepreneurship); **Propose → Debate → Decide** (Politics, Philosophy, Ethics, Business Strategy, Diplomacy, Law, Corporate Governance); **Sense → Interpret → Act** (Biology, Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, Human Cognition, Environmental Monitoring); **Imagine → Structure → Manifest** (Art, Architecture, Engineering, Product Design, Scientific Theorizing, Business Development); **Hypothesize → Experiment → Validate** (Scientific Method, Medicine, Product Testing, Technological Development, Academic Research); **Assess → Limit → Optimize** (Engineering, Finance, Business Strategy, Software Development, Logistics, Manufacturing); **Gather → Filter → Synthesize** (Data Science, Intelligence Analysis, Market Research, Journalism, Academic Research); **Inquire → Define → Solve** (Philosophy, Mathematics, Engineering, Scientific Method, Education, Strategic Planning)

# Section II: The I-Ching Basics

## The Structure of Trigrams and Hexagrams

The I-Ching, like the thologram, has the basic concept of a trigram as the stable building block of structure. In the I-Ching, a trigram is simply three states of yin/yang together to form a stable concept. There are eight possible combinations when using yin and yang (shown below).

<img src='../Images/i-ching-8.png' style='float:right;width:10%'/>The I-Ching also has a concept of a “lower” and an “upper” state. It describes the lower state as earth, matter, the subjective, the hidden, the inner, etc. depending on context, and the “upper” state as that of heaven, ideas, archetypes, the outer, exposed and the arena of creation, etc, also depending on context. Just as the yin and yang lines represent the two states of something, the upper and lower trigrams represent the two states of the stable concept created by those lines. Already we see the self-similar properties of dualities of trinities as shown in the thologram as well.

Pairing these eight upper trigrams with the eight lower trigrams results in a total of 64 hexagrams, shown below (even values are blue, odd values are red, for easier viewing). The number under the hexagram is the binary value of the hexagram when considering yin as 0 and yang as 1. This was the original Fu Xi arrangement before the current King Wen order was introduced. Unless otherwise noted, we will be using only the binary value to identify a hexagram.


<center><img src='../Images/ic_64hex.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

While there are 64 hexagrams, it is more useful to think of two different sets of 32 pairs of hexagrams. The reason this is more useful is because we can consider these 32 pairs as 32 singularities that instantiate in two different forms depending on the context.

##### Note: For clarity, referring to hexagrams can take the following form of **2䷁*~0~* the *Receptive***, where **2** is the traditional or King Wen number of the hexagram, **䷁** is the hexagram itself, and the small-italic ***~0~*** being the binary value of the hexagrams where yang=1 and yin=0. The name, ***Receptive***, is the traditional name, which may differ from the Tholonic I Ching name. Unless noted, all the hexagram name in this document are the traditional names.

For example, take the most basic hexagrams (using their binary values, not the numbers given in the I-Ching), 2䷁*~0~* the *Receptive*, and 1䷀*~63~* the *Creative*. Between these two hexagrams all other hexagrams exist, so together, as a pair, they represent one state that includes the broadest context that everything exists within. Another example is the pair of hexagrams 39䷦*~20~* *Obstruction*, which states, ““*When faced with dangerous obstacles it is wise to retreat and prepare accordingly with those of like mind.*”, and it’s opposite, 38 ䷥ *~43~* *Diverging Perspectives* or *Opposition*, which states, “*When opposites meet they must proceed with care, for brusqueness will lead to calamity, but through understanding and cooperation we can change an opposition into a polarity. This is how all things come into being.*”

The meta concept here is one of opposites and how they can interact either through polarity as cooperation or conflict.

## Mapping Trigrams to the Tholonic Model

*Note: To avoid confusion, a tholonic triad, which is essentially a triangle, is called a “triad” to distinguish from the I-Ching trigram.*

A tholonic triad is a bit different, but quite compatible with the I-Ching trigram. Instead of three states that the I-Ching defines as beginning, middle, end, or earth, man, heaven, the triad is made of a source and the two polar opposites that emerge from that source, something like a *synthesis* that holds within it its own *thesis* and *antithesis*. The three lines of a trigram and the three points of a triad correlate with NDC.

The thologram also has a concept of *upper* and *lower* in that the *upper* trigram of the I-Ching, which comes *after* the *lower* trigram, equates nicely to the *child* triad of a tholon, which comes *after* the parent. In other words, the *lower* I-Ching trigram is the *parent* triad of the thologram, and the *upper* I-Ching trigram is the *child* triad of the tholon. We can now see that the final hexagram is perfectly equivalent to a tholon map.


<center><img src='../Images/tri-is-hex.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

It might seem counter intuitive that the *upper* or *outer* trigrams of the I-Ching equates to the smaller embedded triads of the thologram, but in the tholon it is the smallest and most embedded tholons that represent the bleeding edge of reality where new creations are being born, dying, and morphing. The farther “up” the thologram, the more fundamental the changes. In the thologram, the parent triad is what forms the environment or context for a new negotiated (i.e., stable) instance to come into existence, so the parent triad is the incubator, so to speak, for the yet to be manifest N-state and its own duality. The smaller, inner triad inside the parent is where the newly created N-state creates its own environment, which incubates yet another N-state, and so on. This is why the I-Ching’s *lower* trigram equates to the tholon’s *parent* triad, and the *upper* trigram equates to the child tholon’s instantiated *inner* triad.

If the thologram recurses inward, and not outward, does this mean that all creations exist *within* the initial triad? Yes. This means that the initial form that everything exists within is a tetrahedron ,within which are an infinite number of embedded tetrahedrons across an infinite number of generations.

*Note: One interesting detail is when we use the outer triad on the parent level with the inner triad on the child level; all the numbers, as indicated on the image above, for each side equal 9, (1+6+2), (2+4+3), (3+5+1), but if we associated the lower trigram with the inner triad, and the upper trigram with the outer triad, all the numbers for each side equal 12, (4+3+5), (5+1+6), (6+2+4). 9 is a smaller number and is more efficiently expressed (3<sup>3</sup>) than 12, which means it is “simpler” or has “less resistance” than the larger and more complex 12 (2<sup>2</sup>×3). That does not mean other mappings are incorrect, just that this one is the most efficient and therefore more likely to occur.*

## The Six Stages (I-Ching and thologram)

According to the I-Ching there are 6 stages of change that describe the life-cycle of a creation, or instance. This is stated very clearly:

-   *“All movements are accomplished in **six stages**, and the seventh brings return.”* –Hexagram 24 “Return”

-   *“The holy man, who understands the mysteries of creation inherent in end and beginning, becomes superior to the limitations of the transitory. For him, the meaning of time is that in it, the stages of growth can unfold in a clear sequence. He is mindful at every moment and uses the **six stages of growth** as if they were six dragons on which he mounts to heaven.”* –Commentary on hexagram 1, the Creative (Wilhelm/Baynes edition).

This shows a general idea of the 6 steps from an I-Ching and tholonic perspective. We can see these same 6 stages in modern applications, one of the many examples being the popular *Transtheoretical Model* used for addressing issues of growth, recovery, behavior, production, etc. We will use these archetypal qualities as properties of the 6 lines, not simply because it’s a reasonable presumption, but because the original I-Ching texts supports these definitions, as will be shown.

For this example we will use the hexagram 63䷾*~21~* *After Completion*, which represents the perfect or ideal order of the hexagrams.


<center><img src='../Images/simple_lines-1.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

Here is another way to look at the tholonic/I-Ching relationship:


<center><img src='../Images/line-tao.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

One way to understand the 6 stages is by looking at the 6 steps of bifurcation needed to create 64 children from one source. Notice how the 1<sup>st</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> level of bifurcation (blue shaded line) is the tholonic *Negotiation* line, which is the only area where new *N-states* can form to create potential tholons. These lines are the lines of the archetypes of *Inception* and *Emergence* representing the starting line of each of the two trigrams.

Another way of looking at the 6 stages is by comparison. In the image below, I have tried to select the best concepts to map together solely based in what “made sense” to me. I am sure there is a better, more verifiable metric to base these on, so these are shown as example, not as claims.

In the “Tholon” diagram below, the numbers in the center triangle are in their tholonic order and in the other two diagrams, they are in the I-Ching order.


<center><img src='../Images/colorfog-tri2.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

Look at the numbered triangle in the “Plant Example” above. Note the qualities of the points that form the corners (which are yang in nature), such as 1, 3, and 5, (GERMINATE, BLOOM, SEED) form the connecting lines (which are yin in nature) 2, 4, and 6, (growth, fruiting, recycle). Look at the quality of the pairs that are composed of a point and its opposite line. For example, there are three such pairs: GERMINATE/fruiting, BLOOM/recycle, and SEED/growth. We can understand these pairs as the conceptual polarities of the 3 parent concepts:

-   **The Beginning** (germination, reproduction) **The Limits** (blooming and death) **The Work**: What “it must do” as an existence (it must grow, it must seed).

There is yet another way to look at the structure of the lines, and one that is arguably the basis of the current King Wen interpretation of the I-Ching.


<center><img src='../Images/dot-cicrle-ary.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

***Fig. k1*** shows a simple binary tree that starts at the center and bifurcates outward to 64 end-points. This form is especially useful because it so clearly shows the direction of the YIN movement (***Fig. k2a***) and the YANG movement (***Fig. k2b***), and when we add these two opposite moving patterns together we can see an impressive self-similar fractal pattern (***Fig. k3***). ***Fig. k4*** shows the dots and the lines together, but in addition, each of the six concentric bands has been colorized according to their NDC correlation, and the connective lines have been greatly thickened, with a Taijitu symbol added to the middle to represent the original duality.


<center><img src='../Images/dot-circle-anatomy.png' style='width:80%'/></center>

Each of these concentric rings represents each successive bifurcation which defines each of the lines in a hexagram. The above image shows the path from the beginning to the end for hexagram 5䷄*~23~* *Waiting/Nourishment*.

This structure tells us a lot about the I-Ching. For example, we would expect to see the more cardinal points hold somewhat of a “cardinal” value. To see this, we highlighted the paths of each of the cardinal and semi-cardinal paths and show the hexagrams they produce along with their traditional meaning (and their traditional number in parenthesis).


<center><img src='../Images/dot-circle-3a-2.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

##### Note: All hexagrams that have a solid yang line in the 6<sup>th</sup> place at the top have values greater than 31, and have “descending” qualities; the expression and releasing of yang energy. These hexagrams are shown in italics in this chapter. All hexagrams that have a broken yin line in the 6<sup>th</sup> place have values less than 32, and demonstrate “ascending” qualities; the accumulation of yang energy. These hexagrams are shown in all CAPS in this chapter.

The first thing we notice is that the exact opposites of , 2䷁*~0~* the ***Receptive***, and 1䷀*~63~* the **CREATIVE** begin and end the cycle at the top. Their opposite pair, at the bottom, is made up of the opposite hexagrams of 24䷗*~1~* the ***Return***, and 44䷫*~62~* **COMING TO MEET**. Considering this is exactly the point where the cycle begins to return, it suggests that the King Wen interpreters of the I-Ching saw this same pattern. The other thing we notice is the symmetry of the numbers, wherein every pair of opposite (ascending and descending) values on opposite sides of the vertical axis always equals 63, for example 5䷘*~57~* **INNOCENCE** and 46䷭*~6~* ***Pushing Upwards*** where 57+6 = 63. The same is true for every lower and upper trigram and their opposite equaling 7, but in the case of the ascending trigrams, the axis is diagonal lowest right sector to the highest left sector, and for the descending trigrams, the axis is mirrored, from lowest-left to the highest-right sector.

We can also see that each pair of hexagrams for the same point has a meaning that is similar from two different aspects. On the above-right image, we have renamed these points according to the theme they share. Below we look at how this was arrived at. It is recommended that you look at the meaning in full in the Wilhelm/Baynes version *and* the Tholonic interpretation. Pay attention to how in the case of *ascending* hexagrams, the influence is always from nature, or the times, or other influence beyond the control of man. In other words, the *context* in which something is created, i.e., the *definitions* and *limitations*. In the *descending* hexagrams, it focuses on the same quality but in the hands of man, i.e., what the instance is *contributing* or how it *integrates*. This is the duality that the authors worked with, that of nature vs. man, state vs individual. In the Tholonic model, we see this as *Definition/Limitation* and *Contribution/Integration*. This gives us a great insight into the moral agenda of the ancient authors, which stressed social roles, traditional values, and statism.

Here is an overview of the pairs, using the traditional King Wen hexagrams titles and meanings.

-   Pair 1, **CREATIVE/Receptive**. Both of these hexagrams define an extreme end point, the polarity that defines the spectrum within which every other hexagrams exists. This defines **arena of creation**.

-   Pair 2, **TREADING/Peace**. Both of these describe a time when the high and the low are in **harmony**. In one case (*Peace*), it is the result of the times, and in the other (TREADING), it is the result of decorum and when pleasant manners succeed.

-   Pair 3, **FELLOWSHIP/Approach**. Both hexagrams speak of **progress**. In one case (*Approach*), it is the result of the time, such as spring time. The other case (FELLOWSHIP) speaks of progress in difficult times as long as people unify and are working towards the goals of humanity.

-   Pair 4, **INNOCENCE/Darkening.** Both hexagrams refer to finding the inner light for **guidance**. In one case (*Darkening*), when external circumstances are unfavorable, and in the other (INNOCENCE), when one is at risk of wandering off the path of righteousness.

-   Pair 5, **COMING TO MEET/Return**. Both hexagrams speak of a **reversing course**. In one case (*Return*), it is the natural turn of the cycle when the light returns to the darkness. In the other (COMING TO MEET), it is the result of a decision but warns one of allowing the inferior to gain access to the superior. However, it also admits that this meeting of “inferior” and “superior” is what brings about all life.

-   Pair 6, **CONFLICT/Pushing Upwards**. Both hexagrams speak of the need for **adaptation** if progress is to succeed. In the one case (*Pushing Upward*), because of one’s modesty and adaptability. In the other, (CONFLICT) there is a warning to avoid treachery and only consider modest and amicable means of progressing when met with resistance.

-   Pair 7, **RETREAT/Army** Both hexagrams speak of the management of **force**. In one case (*Army*), it speaks of discipline, as well as trust in a leader, that is necessary for a force to be effective. In the other (RETREAT), the wise use of force is needed when facing a stronger force.

-   Pair 8, **STANDSTILL/Modesty**. Both hexagrams describe a time when the end of a cycle has arrived, and as it is returning to the point it started, the final ***destination***. In one case (*Modesty*), it tells of how the law of nature is to raise that which is low, and lower that which is high. In the other case (STANDSTILL), the end has arrived as confusion and disorder because the dark waxing power has given rise to lowly people. In such times, faith in one’s principles is the only recourse.

These pairs can be reduced again to a more abstracted four pairs, and they can be reduced further to two, which would be the duality from which everything emerges. I argue here that this duality is the same duality that everything evolved from as well, that of *Definition* and *Contribution*, and everything exists as a result of *Negotiation* between those two states.

For those who are familiar with machine learning or artificial intelligence, you’ll notice that this bifurcating concept map (above) is quite similar to a classic neural network architecture (above, lower right), the difference being a neural net connects every parent to all children, while our map’s parents connect only to its two children. The other big difference between a neural net and this concept map is that a neural net is deigned to discover and learn, while this concept map is exposing the pattern that already exists.

## Understanding the Six Lines

There are not 6 lines in order to make 64 hexagrams, there are 64 hexagrams because there are 6 lines. The creators of the I-Ching deliberately chose to use 6 lines because they knew that 6 is the minimum needed to create a complete archetype. This is an idea that we see not only across many cultures all over the world, specifically in their stories of creation, but in science and geometry:

> -   The simplest form of creation, the tetrahedron (and tholonic structure) is composed of 6 vectors.
>
> -   
>
> -   The Abrahamic traditions (i.e., Torah, Old Testament, Quran) say all of creation was accomplished in 6 days.
>
> -   
>
> -   The Babylonian creation myth, the Enuma Elis, where the one God created 6 gods, each in charge of the 6 different aspects of creation (where they spent 2 days creating everything and the rest of their days fighting with each other).
>
> -   
>
> -   The original Greek Titans were 6 men (Oceanus, Coeus, Crius, Hyperion, Iapetus, and Cronus), and their sisters, the Titanides (Theia, Rhea, Themis, Mnemosyne, Phoebe, and Tethys). They were all the children of the original 2 primordial gods, Uranus (primordial sky) and Gaia (primordial earth).
>
> -   
>
> -   In the building blocks of creation (chemistry) we see 6 electrons in carbon, the foundation of life.
>
> -   
>
> -   And, as we we’ll show shortly, The N-source has a value of 6.<img src='../Images/planisphere-nineveh-2.png' style='float:right;width:20%'/>

6 seems to be a very significant number and is firmly associated with the concept of creation. The utility of the number 6 is probably why the Sumerian’s invented a base-6 system, which we still use today (360°, 24 hours, 12 months), which they used to plot the stars with surprising accuracy, as we know from the *Planisphere of Nineveh* (right), and calculated values in the trillions (of what, we don’t know).

Below is a chart that shows a more in-depth descriptions of the 6 steps from a tholonic and I-Ching perspective. It is divided into two hexagrams, *lower* and *upper*. Pay attention to the similarity of the three concepts that each line in the trigram share with each other, as they are essentially mirror aspects of each other.

##### Note: It is both difficult and misleading to use one word to define an archetype that can have many different instances, nevertheless, we do exactly that, but remind the reader that these words are simply hints to a much larger significance.


<center><img src='../Images/line-desc-1.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

Once we cross the line from *lower* to the *upper*, the quality of the line positions flip making what was **yang** in the *lower* trigram **yin** in the *upper* trigram, and visa versa. In the tholon, we see this same reversal in the children tholons, *reflection* triads, and *virtual* tholons.


<center><img src='../Images/line-desc-2.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

Here we equate the *upper* and *lower* trigrams of the I-Ching to the three tholonic attributes of N, D, C


<center><img src='../Images/tho-table.png' style='width:80%'/></center>

Depending on the context (*upper* or *lower*), N, D, and C have slightly different expressions. In the most general sense, N, D, and C can represent many different concepts depending on its context.


<center><img src='../Images/tho-table-2.png' style='width:80%'/></center>

Because the I-Ching is about the nature of unending change, it might serve us to view the stages of change as a continuous stream of change in the form of a wave, which we attempt to do in the image below.


<center><img src='../Images/6stage-side-front.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

This continuity is consistent with the I-Ching when it states: “*All movements are accomplished in six stages, and the seventh brings return.*” Here we see how the seventh stage returns us to the first stage of the next cycle. Another validation of using this waveform as a model is that the lower trigram of lines 1, 2, and 3 are, in fact, in the lower part of the waveform, and the upper trigram of 4,5, and 6 are in the upper part.

On the right is a front view of the waveform that shows how the cycle is composed of six stages that alternate between yin (orange) and yang (blue). Within one complete cycle we have highlighted the significant axis and their yin and yang properties. Using the archetypal yin/yang values for the six lines, we see that the upper half, being outward in nature, and the left half, being ascending in nature, are both yang. The lower half, being inner in nature, and the right half, being descending in nature, are both yin. This results in four quadrants that are, respectively, yin-yin (`00`<img src='../Images/bc/bigram00.png' style='width:35px'/> or 0), yin-yang (`10` <img src='../Images/bc/bigram01.png' style='width:35px'/>or 2), yang-yang (`11` <img src='../Images/bc/bigram11.png' style='width:35px'/>or 3), and yang-yin (`01`<img src='../Images/bc/bigram01.png' style='width:35px'/> or 1), which are shown in each corner as bigrams.

It might seem odd that the cycle start at the 4:00 position on the circular chart, and not the 6:00 position, but the positions of the lines were determined by their yin/yang qualities. The vertical axis is the only axis that aligns with the 6 axes of the lines, and as line 2 is a yin line within a yin hemisphere, it naturally represent the nadir. The same is true for its opposite, line 5.

Interesting side note, in Christian monasticism, traditional Chinese medicine, some military and agricultural traditions, and even human hormonal cycles, 4:00 AM is considered the start of a new day. This correlates with the Medieval folklore and Christian traditions that “devil’s hour” is 3:00 AM.

## The Form of Hexagrams

We can easily recognize this same archetypal structure of the I-Ching and the tholon in many systems, from the process of mitosis to the shape of trees and plants with their *inner* roots and *outer* branches and leaves. This is significant because in the thologram there is a similar concept of a real tholon and a virtual tholon which are matched to create a complete tholon. We also saw an example of this in the book “THOLONIA - The Mechanocs of Existentian Awareness”, when looking at how the complete tholon models quarks to the proton.

In the thologram, all odd numbered tholons are *real* and all even numbered tholons are *virtual*. Likewise all hexagrams that begin with a yin line are even numbered hexagrams, and those that begin with a yang are odd numbered. We now have a very clean mapping between the thologram and the I-Ching of *virtual* as yin and *real* as yang.

We arrived at the same results of 6 fundamental concepts formed by a pair of triads from two completely different processes; the process of the thologram was based on creating a tetrahedron from a point, while the I-Ching is based solely in the binary system.

There are many mappings and similarities between the tholon and the I-Ching, but I will only show one more because it not only maps hexagrams to tholons, but to basic physical structures in nature.

If we create a binary tree of the I-Ching where the bifurcations follow the path of least resistance, meaning they will always move into the emptiest space, we end up with bifurcations separated by 60° (which is also the angle that creates a tetrahedron/tholon). This would then create the following patterns for each of the 6 generations of bifurcations.


<center><img src='../Images/overlay-gen.png' style='width:90%'/></center>

Simply splitting one line into two lines, in accordance with the laws of entropy, we naturally form a pattern of hexagons that perfectly matches the pattern of tholonic expansion. This is because the I-Ching and the thologram represent the same laws but in the context of a binary system (I-Ching) and a trinary, or synergetic, system (thologram). Not surprisingly, the one point they both naturally center around is the N-source, which we have already shown to be equivalent to the Taijitu ☯.

The image below is a more in-depth version of the overlay above. In that image, we follow each bifurcation starting with the one point from which the original duality emerged from. The arrows show the direction of the movement, with left-sided (or *port* side, as the side is relative to the direction of the arrow) arrows as yin, and right-sided (or *starboard* sided) arrows as yang (or visa-versa). Doubled headed arrows indicate that one line (in the same direction) is shared by two parents, and lines with arrows in both directions indicate a shared line that is bidirectional.


<center><img src='../Images/hex_builder.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

***Fig. hb1*** shows the paths of all 64 hexagrams of the I-Ching which are the result of 6 generations. ***Fig hb2*** shows the 7th generation. This is added only to show that with the 7th generations we get the first complete closure of a hexagram (the first one, in the center), which is another example of the “*All movements are accomplished in six stages, and the **seventh** brings return*”. ***Fig hb3*** is the same pattern, but iterated over 13 generations, generating 8,192 (or 2<sup>13</sup>) final values. It is included simply to show how the larger form remains a hexagram and how only the last two generations (purple and cyan) are even visible, occluding all previous generations. Notice how at this point, the dominant pattern, which will remain the dominant pattern for all future children, are two sets of three double-headed arrows, one set from the final generation (right), and one from the previous generation (left), shown in this image<img src='../Images/triplet-pairs.png' style='width:30px'/>.This pattern of 2×3 (final generations × intersections of movement) does not appear until the 2<sup>3</sup> (or 8<sup>th</sup>) generation. Because new generations overlap the previous when shown in two dimensions, we can’t see that this is really more of a 3D design, with the originating point in the center, expanding with each generation, creating a hexagonal cone.

Also of interest in this diagram is how it shows that the original N-source is the result of its own creation *after* 6 generations. In other words, after 6 generations, a new N-source is created that begins a new cycle and *departs* from the previous. Notice that it is the 5<sup>th</sup> place where two different cycles come together for the first time, which is why the 5<sup>th</sup> place is one of *integration*.

All of this is to demonstrate how the two systems are quite compatible to the point where not only can the entire I-Ching be mapped to the thologram, but the thologram can greatly elaborate on the I-Ching and give it a 3D structure, and given its recursive nature, infinitely so.

## ~~The I-Ching as a Technical Manual~~

~~The I-Ching is, and always was, a technical manual.~~

> ##### ~~*“After meeting genuine teachers all my doubts disappeared, so that for the first time I realized that the Tao of spiritual alchemy is none other than the Tao of I-Ching, the Tao of sages is none other than the Tao of immortals, and that the I-Ching is not a book of divination, but rather a study of investigation, of principles, fulfillment of nature, and arrival at the meaning of life”*. \~ Liu Yiming (18th c. Taoist master)~~

> ##### ~~*“Although the words are very clear, yet they are also very vague. The shallow may take the I-Ching to be a book of divination, but the profound consider it the secret of the Celestial Mechanism”*. \~ Lu Dongbin, 9th c. Taoist master (introduction of The Taoist I-Ching)~~

~~In the tholon, hexagons are formed by 6 N-sources. Any hexagon, therefore, has a virtual N-source that is induced into being by virtue of its creations, the dimensional lines. The image below shows the progression of an evenly distributed bifurcating tree (60° separation), which includes many overlaps. The overlapping redundancy of the pattern unfolds as we narrow the separation. In the beginning, the originating hexagon(s) have an evenly distributed concentration of N-sources (represented as a blue-tinted density cloud of the general area where the virtual N-sources will be located). As the pattern unfolds from its hexagonal form, we see the density move from the center to the outer edge and beyond. If we apply this concept to the most obvious instance of an actual tree as a metaphor, we would see that, as a seed, in the inception stage, the highest density of N-sources exist around the center. As a full grown tree, they collect around its leaves and flowers. In its final stage, the N-sources form nothing more than a line that extends infinitely (according to the math).~~

~~*Note: While I have not shown the N-state distribution cloud for middle transitions (because it was too difficult to show in a reasonable manner), you can imagine the transition from the round N-state cloud in Inception transitioning to the N-state cloud in Diffusion, which is a one-dimensional line that stretches to infinity. Imagine the transitional clouds centered around the densest part of the “branches”, and increasingly and exponentially expanding outward and upward.*~~

# Section III: Tholonic-I Ching Mapping

## Directional Flow of the I-Ching

The I-Ching, according to the Tholonic model, has two “directions”: ascending and descending. The ascending direction consists of the first 32 binary values, while the descending direction consists of the following 32 binary values.

In the Tholonic model, the natural order of change follows this progression: Low-entropy chaos → order and complexity → High-entropy chaos.

A good example of this pattern is the progression of the universe from the Big Bang to its ultimate fate. The universe begins in a state of low-entropy chaos (the Big Bang), expands and develops increasing order and complexity, and eventually declines into high-entropy chaos, such as Heat Death, the Big Freeze, the Big Rip, Vacuum Decay, the Black Hole Era, and Hawking Radiation Evaporation, as all structure dissipates.

The ascending side of the I-Ching is where we move from the ultimate yin state, 2䷁*~0~* *Receptive*, to the maximum yang state that can exist in the yin domain, 43䷪*~31~* *Breakthrough*. The descending side begins as 23䷖*~32~* *Splitting Apart*, the maximum yin state that can exist in the yang domain, and continues to the ultimate yang state of 1䷀*~63~* *The Creative*.

This model indicates that ䷁ and ䷀ are the two states of maximum chaos, the yin chaos of maximum entropy and the yang chaos of minimum entropy. It may seem odd to associate yin with low entropy and yang with high entropy, but the reasoning is a follows:

Receptivity (䷁) is the most compatible with low entropy because it represents a state of maximum potential, where energy remains unstructured and available for directed transformation. Like a vacuum that can accommodate limitless expansion, an all-Yin system has no imposed direction or movement, meaning it holds the greatest capacity for ordered, purposeful development. Since low entropy corresponds to a system where energy is highly concentrated and has not yet been dispersed, receptivity aligns perfectly with this principle, as it provides the ideal environment for structured emergence without yet engaging in full expression.

Creation (䷀) is the most compatible with high entropy because it represents the full expression and expansion of energy into its maximum form. With all lines being Yang, there is no room left for additional directed movement, meaning the system has reached its most fully realized, high-entropy state. In this sense, creation aligns with high entropy because energy has been fully utilized and distributed, leaving no latent potential for further directed transformation. Like a star that has burned through its fuel, creation signifies a state where all available energy has been expressed, requiring a return to receptivity for renewal.

This diagram shows the order of pairs and the entire sequence (the 10 red pairs of hexagrams have a balance of three yin and three yang).


<center><img src='../Images/0_008.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

This seems to suggest that the ultimate end of the Universe is represented by 1䷀*~63~* *The Creative*, which seems contrary to reason, but here is the reasoning that supports this idea.

The 1䷀*~63~* *The Creative* is the universe at its most complete, the culmination of all possible expression. It is the final state in which energy has been fully structured, fully realized, and fully spent. Nothing more can be created because everything that could exist has already emerged. All differentiation, all movement, all transformation has reached its peak, leaving no further possibilities for change. In this moment, the universe is absolute, total, and without remainder, a condition so complete that nothing new can enter, nothing old can be undone. It is a moment of pure finality, where all that has been set into motion has played out its course, and what remains is a universe that has nothing left to become.

Yet this ultimate expression is, paradoxically, the threshold of a new beginning. When all has been fully realized, there is no longer movement, and when movement ceases, the conditions for a new cycle arise. The Creative, in exhausting itself, returns to 2䷁*~0~* *Receptive*, not as a separate phase, but as the inevitable consequence of total expression. Just as the highest note of a song fades into silence, or a fire that has consumed all its fuel leaves behind the empty space where new growth can occur, the universe at its most complete is indistinguishable from the universe before it was born. The final expression is not merely an end; it is a return to the pure potential from which everything emerges.

Thus, the greatest fullness and the greatest emptiness are the same. The ultimate creation and the formless void are not opposites, but two ways of perceiving a singular reality. One is the last moment before dissolution, the other is the first moment before formation—but thermodynamically, they are identical. What we call an ending is nothing but the stillness before a new beginning, and what we call a beginning is only the next emergence of movement from that stillness. The Creative, having fully expressed itself, does not collapse into nothingness—it *becomes nothingness*, and in doing so, it prepares for creation once more.

Lao Tzu not only alludes to this duality of oneness when describing the nature of the Tao, but is quite is clear that the end of one begets the other, alternating in sequence, each being the cause and the effect of the other.

> ##### As soon as beauty is known by the world as beautiful, it becomes ugly. *As soon as virtue is being known as something good, it becomes evil.* *Therefore being and non-being give birth to each other.* *Difficult and easy accomplish each other.* *Long and short form each other.* *High and low distinguish each other.* *Sound and tone harmonize each other.* *Before and after follow each other as a sequence.* \~ Lao Tzu,Tao Te Ching

We can see a similar pattern in the evolution of the lines if we apply the six stages of growth to the previous model of the all the lines in all 64 hexagrams. 


<center><img src='../Images/hex2tree.png' style='width:100%'/></center>



## Just a Touch of Chaos

The following is a bit of a tangent, but worth sharing before we continue with the lines. Below is a graphic that shows three conditions of the descending pattern of chaos→order. The first conditions is *Maximum Freedom*, where the direction of the children is undetermined and completely unlimited. The second condition, *Limited Freedom*, is where the direction of the children is limited by 96% (4% freedom). The final condition, *No Freedom*, is where there can be no deviation from the rule. This is an excellent example of the effect of, and necessity for, definition and limitation.


<center><img src='../Images/3stage-freedom.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

The forms used to represent the stages of change are “perfect”archetypes, in that they adhere strictly to a very tight set of rules. In reality, there are many other forces in play other than an isolated set of rules making it rare, if not impossible, for a perfect archetypes to instantiate. These other forces introduce variations. In the image above, with just a little bit of chaos we get forms that are much closer to what we see in the real world. In the images below, we added a little more variation to our perfect process on just two variables, length and angle, resulting in a wider variety of “realistic” forms. The black forms below each variation shows the perfect archetype they were based on.


<center><img src='../Images/arch-hex-sm.png' style='width:80%'/></center>

## By the Numbers

Let’s run another test to see if the thologram and the I-Ching are two views of the same model.

Previously we assigned the positions of the points on the tholon as 1 through 6 in order to work with the positions of the I-Ching lines, but while the I-Ching order (sequential from top including lines) was 1,2,3,4,5,6, the tholonic order was 0,5,1,3,2,4. Here is where the validity of that order is shown.

Now we need to work with the hexagrams and their values, so we need to use the position of the points as the exponential value of 2 (because we’re working in binary), and to do that we need to start counting at 0, not 1. In ***Fig. e1*** (below) you can see the values arrived at for each point, and the exponent used to get that value. ***Fig. e2*** shows the sum of these values for each triad and each side. In ***Fig e3*** we have added the name and the hexagram. Don’t forget that all these numbers are binary, and not the numbers as they appear in the traditional I-Ching layout.


<center><img src='../Images/tritest.png' style='width:80%'/></center>

##### Note: We identify the lines by grouping together the two points that form that line. This is usually shown with the traditional **overline** symbol, however, due to the limitation of the text formatting tools, in written text this will be shown as underlined, for example <u>ND</u> refers to the connecting line between N and D)*.


<center><img src='../Images/trialgebra.png' style='width:30%'/></center>

Here some other observations:

-   The sum of any triad and the side opposite that triad always equal 63, the maximum number possible. This was exciting to discover as it supports the tholonic claim that the effect of any point can be seen on the side opposite that point. In our example above, we see the side 41䷨*~35~* *Decrease* plus the opposing corner of 31䷞*~28~* *Wooing* equals 35 + 28 = 63
-   
-   Every number our example (14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56), including their sums (63, 70), is a product of the *white dot*, which has a value of 7 multiplied 2 to 10.
-   
-   Every value of a triad plus its opposite border equals 9 (6+3, 7+2, 5+4, 8+1). This lends more support to the tholonic idea that a corner point (or in this case, corner triad) is paired with it’s opposite border.
-   
-   Every hexagram derived from the tholonic values has an equal number of yin and yang lines (only 10 of the 32 pairs of hexagrams in the I-Ching have an equal number of yin and yang)
-   
-   Only the numbers of the top triad, which is the originating triad, are odd.

There are many more patterns and relationships as well, and this is only within one tholon that has no parents or children!

## Better Proof

Given that every number has a patterned relationship with one or more numbers, we can reverse engineer where every I Ching hexagram sits in the thologram, meaning, we can assign a unique binary value to every vector (or point, but we are only showing vectors here). Remember the chapter that hypothesized how if each tholon had a unique binary value then we could unfold the history of that tholon from the moment of creation to the present? The I-Ching is an example of just that, with a very small set of unique binary numbers.

There is some significant evidence that the I-Ching and the thologram are based on the same model. Given that the Kabbalah and the I-Ching are also based on the same model (which I will not elaborate on here as it is way too long), we can speculate that there is an underlying model that many perspectives of understanding are based on. I do not doubt that the thologram could be used as a tool for divination, mysticism, magic, alchemy, etc. as much as it could for chemistry, physics, electronics, and many other applications. Any truth that exists can be found in many different instances, and its truth is just as valid in one context as another. The only limitation is the creative imagination of the perceiver.

However, if you still have doubts, what follows is a demonstration of how the value of *pi* (π) can be derived using the Tholonic model along with the values shown here derived from the I-Ching. We can also find *pi* in the thologram alone, as previously described, by using the total number of N-sources for all the real and virtual tholons for each generations. While this technique uses the same method, it is using very different data.

<img src='../Images/times7.png' style='width:80%'/>

***Fig. h1*** shows the hexagram values as multiples of 7. ***Fig h2*** shows the same values, but shows how the same border values of 2, 3 and 5 apply to all the triads. Let’s apply the Tholonic model to these numbers. We arrived at these numbers by taking the sums of the binary values for each side, as shown above, which gave us 14, 21 and 35, As these numbers are all multiples of 7, we use the multiplier values.

Notice how the edges that are universal to all triads are the first three prime numbers, 2, 3, 5, and the multiplier is the 4<sup>th</sup> prime, and top triad, 7. We’ll assign these values to the lower case version of their opposite point; *n=2, d=3, c=5*. This also means that *<u>ND</u>*=5, *<u>DC</u>*=2, *<u>CN</u>*=3.

The Tholonic model states that the *green dot* (*Definition*) is what creates limits and restricts the N-state, so D reduces N. The *red dot (Contribution)*, seeing as it contributes, will be added to N.

We start by assigning N=1. As D and C are part of, or children of N, we then calculate D as $\frac{1}{c}$ and C as $\frac{1}{d}$. To create a new instance of N we start with the original N, subtract D, and add C. So, N<sub>1</sub>=N<sub>0</sub> - $\frac{1}{d}+\frac{1}{c}$, or N<sub>1</sub>=1 - $\frac{1}{5}+\frac{1}{2}$= 0.78539822525372. We repeat this process again, but we increment d and *c* by *n<sup>2</sup>*. After doing this a million or so times, we get the number 0.7853982294712. Multiply this number by *n<sup>2</sup>* (which is 4) and you get π.

This graph below diagrams the process (and shows the results already multiplied by 4). Notice how this is exactly the same model that was proposed for transforming a holon from the holarchic model, to a tholon. Included are the formulas that show how to do the calculations with nothing but the existing I-Ching values and using the mathematical relationships of the tholon (see Appendix C or the book)


<center><img src='../Images/pi-holons2.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

One interesting observation is that the first triad if NCD uses a simple formula, and all the rest use that same formula, but modified by *n*, which didn’t exist in the first triad. This is an excellent example of the “*The Tao gives birth to One. One gives birth to Two. Two gives birth to Three. Three gives birth to the ten thousand things.*”

For anyone that wants to replicate/test this process, the program is at the end of this book.

We can also calculate the value for Phi (φ, 1.618) and the Fibonacci sequence using a similar process, and if we replace the values of 1,2,3,5 with the values of 2<sup>0</sup>, 2<sup>1</sup>, 2<sup>2</sup>, 2<sup>3</sup>, (1,2,4,8) the final value eventually settles down to the number 3.

There are many, many relationships, patterns, values, and functions in this simple triad, but for many of them it is hard to say which of their products are *data* and which are *information*, as the Tholonic model defines those concepts.

## Reconstruction

If we rebuild the I-Ching from the ground up integrating elements from the I-Ching, the Tholonic model, and Western philosophy, we get something like the following:

<center><img src='../Images/tholonic-pakua-desc.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

Here are some points about this model:

The 8 trigrams (this is called the *Pa Kua* in the I-Ching) are arranged in their binary, or natural order in pairs. The trigrams advance as opposite pairs of 0-7 <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b00.png' style='width:30px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b07.png' style='width:30px'/>, 1-6 <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b01.png' style='width:30px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b06.png' style='width:30px'/>, 2-5 <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b02.png' style='width:30px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b05.png' style='width:30px'/>, and 3-4 <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b03.png' style='width:30px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b04.png' style='width:30px'/> in the clockwise direction. This means the first 4 trigrams are 0,1,2,3, <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b00.png' style='width:30px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b01.png' style='width:30px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b02.png' style='width:30px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b03.png' style='width:30px'/> and the next 4 trigrams are 7,6,5,4 <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b07.png' style='width:30px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b06.png' style='width:30px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b05.png' style='width:30px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b04.png' style='width:30px'/>. This results in a pattern where all opposing numbers always equal 7, the maximum number that can be represented in binary using three places.

**Ring 7**: There are three divisions per quadrant representing the three stages of tholonic movement; *Negotiation*, *Definition*, and *Contribution* (ring 7). However, it is more accurate to say there are three *phases* or cycles of movement, conceptually similar to how three phase electricity works. All three phases are present all the time at every point, just at different points in the cycle, and presumably in the (archetypal) order of the image below.


<center><img src='../Images/three_phase_waveform.png' style='width:60%'/></center>

The two major axis are represented by the four cardinal points. The vertical axis is represented by the most extreme trigrams (7<img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b07.png' style='width:30px'/>, 0<img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b00.png' style='width:30px'/>) for the “north” and the “south”, and horizontal axis by the most balanced trigrams (5<img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b05.png' style='width:30px'/>, 2<img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b02.png' style='width:30px'/>) for the “east” and “west”.

**Ring 1**: The other 4 trigrams (ring 1) are the most imbalanced and are therefore more unstable/dynamic.

The vertical and horizontal axis *reflects*, and the horizontal axis *reflect*s as well as *reverses* (like a photo negative). This is why the lines in the east are a mirror of the lines in the west. This is also true for the lines in the north and the south, but in addition, they are also reversed along the horizontal axis, like a photo negative.


<center><img src='../Images/mirror.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

There are four quadrants, each with three stages which are defined by the sequential lines (ring 6) of the intermediary trigram (ring 1). Each positive line is matched with its opposite negative line.

**Ring 5:** Because the first 4 trigrams (<img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b00.png' style='width:30px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b01.png' style='width:30px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b02.png' style='width:30px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b03.png' style='width:30px'/>) all have yin lines at the top-most position in the trigram we refer to them as ascending because they begin at 0 and ascend towards 7. Likewise, the next 4 trigrams (<img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b07.png' style='width:30px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b06.png' style='width:30px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b05.png' style='width:30px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b04.png' style='width:30px'/>) have yang lines in their top-most positions, so we call these descending because they start with 7 and descend towards 0.

**Ring 4**: The upper hemisphere is yang and the lower is yin (ring 4). Because the upper hemisphere consists of 4 yang lines and 2 yin line (ring 6) and has the cardinal value of 7 (ring 8), it is predominantly yang in nature. The opposite is true for the lower hemisphere which is predominantly yin in nature.

## The Origin of Trigrams

We have yet to look closely at how a trigram evolves from nothing. Below is a binary tree that begins with a point of unity that divides itself into two states, 0 and 1. This establishes the most fundamental concept of yin and yang. This is then followed by each of those children doing the same by creating their own two children of 0 and 1. We can see that there are now 4 children, each defined by the parent’s fundamental yin or yang, and then adding to that the yin or yang of the child. These 4 children have the values 0, 2, 1, 3, as shown by the bigrams. This is done one more time to create the final branch of 8 children, each with a value determined by adding their yin or yang value to the bigrams passed down by the parents. Now we have 8 trigrams or 0, 4, 2, 3, 6, 1, 5, 3, 7. Unfortunately, this order seems to lack any symmetry or pattern that is compatible with our model, suggesting it is incorrect.


<center><img src='../Images/btree-top.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

However, if we flip the tree upside down, like a mirror image, the order immediately appears! This is important when we are adding lines, because if we start with <img src='../Images/bc/bigram00.png' style='width:30px'/> and add a <img src='../Images/bc/yang.png' style='width:30px'/>, you might expect we get a <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b04.png' style='width:30px'/>, but as we will need to flip it to maintain the “mirrored” order, we will actually get a <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b01.png' style='width:30px'/>. Now we can see the first order of \[01\], the 2<sup>nd</sup> order of \[0123\] and the final and 3<sup>rd</sup> order of \[01234567\]. Of course, we could also achieve this order if we only added new lines to below the previous lines, with the first line being at the top, but that woudl nto be consistent with the I Ching hexagrams.


<center><img src='../Images/btree-bottom.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

This little example shows us that the I-Ching is suggesting that the order of creation is one of bottom-up, not top-down. The top-down order is a mirror image of the bottom-up order and visa versa, and the top-down order, while being a perfect mirror of the bottom-up order, makes no sense in a top-down view of reality. it is also suggestive of one perspective being chaotic pattern, and its reflection being an ordered pattern.

Now that we have our model in order, we can see if our trigrams fit into it in any way that makes sense. We do this simply by assigning the names of the trigrams that have the same values, while also assigning the first two branches of 0 and 1 to be that of the two branches of the tholonic trigram, like thus:


<center><img src='../Images/attr-btree.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

We may run into a problem of semantics and context using the words *Definition* and *Contribution* in this binary framework. The words yin and yang seem to fit much better, but it is difficult to say *Definition* is yin and *Contribution* is yang, as both can be both depending on the context. For now, we will say *Definition* is yin in the way that it limits the expression, and *Contribution* is yang in the way that is it returning some creation back to the parent.

The problems of the semantics of duality have been around a long time, so we will defer to the wisdom of those that wrestled with this problem from the past.

-   The two faces of *Shakti*; *Sambhuthi* (that which is manifested, yang, contributing) and *Asambhuti* (that which is not manifested, yin, defining/limiting).
-   
-   The Zoroastrian’s *Ahura Mazda* (eternal spirit of creation, yang, contributing) and *Angra Mainyu* (spirit of destruction, yin, defining/limiting).
-   
-   The Persian *Manichaeism*, where the first creation was that of the World of Light, “good”, ruled by the *Father of Greatness* (yang, contributing) and the the *World of Darkness*, “evil”, ruled by the *King of Darkness* (yin, defining/limiting).

There are countless examples, but here we would like to stay away from religious concepts, so we will refer to the primal binary as simply the *Defining Yin* and the *Contributing Yang*. Perhaps the *Defining Yin* can also be considered *order*, or the movement of chaos to order, coming into form, creation, explicity, and the *Contributing Yang* can be considered *chaos*, or the movement of order to chaos, dissolution of form, implicity, return to the source.

We can see that every bigram creates two trigram children, and this pair of trigrams is always made up of one a cardinal element and one in a dynamic element. This suggests that the parent is both a state (cardinal/stable) and an energy (dynamic/unstable) combined. This is not far off from the two properties that created the zero-dimensional point, where the state is the *awareness* of the concept of a point, and the energy is the *intention* to conceive it. Both of these qualities exist in the bigram but can only find separation in the (trigram) children. We can also see that the nature of the energy is compatible with the nature of state. Here we have a bit of a challenge, because we do not have good words that describe these states and their movement, similar in the way “balance” is a state and a movement. Computer programming languages do have such a concept. It is called a “class”, and a class contains both static information and the dynamic code that can act on that information. We will have to make do with some borrowed and creative nouns and verbs.

For example, what can we call the parent that has the combined state of EARTH and an energy of *Filling*? It would have to be some quality that is common to both of these things. I have chosen the word “**Absorb**”, because the act of absorbing is the process of *Filling* (of the absorptive material), and the element of EARTH, being the perfect yin of 0, can only absorb and be filled. Readers my find better words or concepts to describe these pairs. Think of the ones used here as suggestions.

***Contract*** is used to describe the nature of WATER, because water, which always travels the path of least resistance, will always pool, *Collecting* at the lowest point. Of course, all energy travels the path of least resistance, but WATER is meant to describe that property, so we can say that all energy has the property of WATER.

***Consume*** describes the nature of FIRE, as it consumes, or uses up or *empties* its fuel. This is almost the textbook definition of *Emptying*.

***Expand*** describes the nature of AIR, as it will expand into every place of existence to the edge of the universe. AIR here does not simply mean the air we breathe, but refers more to the space that exists between all things, be they atoms or planets. If one considered the expanding universe as a function of AIR, which was itself a function of the Big Bang, the verb of *Release* fits nicely. From this perspective, AIR might also be the element of dark matter.

Here are the properties of the 4 bigrams:


<center><img src='../Images/bigrams-ele.png' style='width:20%'/></center>

Let’s recap how we are describing the elements and processes of the eight trigrams.

We have arrived at the first pair, the original 0 and 1, the parents of all things, which, according to the Tholonic model, have the two attributes of the primal yin as DEFINITION and the primal yang as CONTRIBUTION. Here, DEFINITION refers to the limits that everything that exists must exist within. These are defined by the laws of physics and nature, the environment, the available resources, the integration with other processes, and, of course, the limitation and definition of form itself with it’s three dimensions. CONTRIBUTION refers to what the creation in questions returns to the source from which it came. Various models imply various ways to understand the purpose of existence. The Tholonic model seems to be suggesting that the purpose of existence, and of life, is to be able to contribute back to the parent, the source, from which all creation sprung.

Here is an alternative way of looking at this model. Notice how all the horizontal pairs of pink dots equal 7, and all the pairs of orange dots equals 3, and how descriptions are opposite in nature for every pair.


<center><img src='../Images/btree-circ.png' style='width:60%'/></center>

With the introduction of bigrams, let’s look at the order of the trigrams again.


<center><img src='../Images/8-fold-1.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

The chart below shows the two dimensions of the bigram as described by their children. The cardinal elements are across the top, and the dynamic properties down the side. Using what we know about the trigrams we can deduce the nature of the bigrams. You might also notice that the bigrams are identical to the two leftmost values of the boolean logic statement “011 AND 010 = 01”. This is called Boolean Algebra and was first conceived by George Boole (1854) in the book “*An Investigation of the Laws of Thought*.” and was incorporated into electrical circuits about 100 years ago.


<center><img src='../Images/elementsgrid.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

While there may be many ways to create order of the trigrams, the Tholonic model continually re-validates itself every time we look at it from a different perspective. How, then, do these trigrams relate to a tholon? If we mapped the binary values to the tholon, the relationship is obvious and powerful, as shown in the graphic below.


<center><img src='../Images/tri-tholon.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

Here are some of the points spelled out:

-   The same two I-Ching trigrams of 1 <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b01.png' style='width:30px'/> *Filling* and 6 <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b06.png' style='width:30px'/> *Release* exist in both the top triad and the opposing bottom <u>CD</u> edge. In the top triad they exist as the lower trigram *inner filling* and the upper trigram *outer release* to create hexagram 42䷩*~49~* **Increase**, wherein it states:

    > *Sacrifice on the part of those above for the increase of those below*

    Across the bottom <u>CD</u> edge they are arranged as the lower trigram of *inner release* and the upper trigram as *outer filling* to create the hexagram 32䷟*~14~* **Duration**, wherein is states:

    > *Duration is rather the self-contained and therefore self-renewing movement of an organized, firmly integrated whole, taking place in accordance with immutable laws and beginning anew at every ending.*

    These two definitions are remarkably in sync with the tholonic arrangement shown

-   Every corner hexagram value (28, 42, 49, or 7×4, 7×6, 7×7) which is yang in nature, is inverted on its opposite edge (35, 21, 14, or 7×5, 7×3, 7×2), which are yin in nature.

-   The two extremes, 7 <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b07.png' style='width:30px'/>and 0 <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b00.png' style='width:30px'/>, are in the center as 12䷋*~56~* **Standstill** of AIR above EARTH. This would appear to be a good candidate for the base of the tetrahedron.

-   The top hexagram in the position of *Negotiation* is that of 42䷩*~49~* **Increase** is composed of *Filling* and *Releasing*. In the position of *Definition* is *Fire and Water (available resources)*, and in the position of *Contribution* is that of *Collecting and Emptying*… and between them, on the axis of *Filling and Release*, which is exactly the same as the parent, they have created AIR and EARTH, the upper and lower limits of reality. The fact that AIR and EARTH create the hexagram 12䷋*~56~* **Standstill** does not bode well for us dwellers of the material reality, at least in the traditional translations, as it more of a warning than anything else:

    > *Heaven and earth are out of communion and all things are benumbed. What is above has no relation to what is below, and on earth confusion and disorder prevail. The dark power is within, the light power is without. Weakness is within, harshness without. Within are the inferior, and without are the superior. The way of inferior people is in ascent; the way of superior people is one the decline. But the superior people do not allow themselves to be turned from their principles. If the possibility of exerting influence is closed to them, they nevertheless remain faithful to their principles and withdraw into seclusion.*

Unfortunately, this same sentiment is shared by other enlightened voices:

-   Gnostic’s: *“He who has known the world has found a corpse; and he who has found a corpse, the world is not worthy of him.”* (Quoting Jesus, Nag Hammadi Text);
-   
-   The First Noble Truth of Buddha that *“Life is suffering”* (and the other three noble truths aren’t that optimistic either);
-   
-   The Christian Bible’s (Genesis 6:12) *“God observed all this corruption in the world, for everyone on earth was corrupt”*, a theme that returns many times;
-   
-   Hinduism’s Bhagavad-gita describes the world as a place *“full of miseries”*, and Krishna called it a *“place of distress”*.

The jury is pretty unanimous. However, in the “Tholonic I CHING”, this hexagram is called **Stagnation** and in interpreted as follows, which is far more accurate in describing the foundation of the material world, which is what this hexagram is representing in the tholon:

> > -   *The state of blockage that arises when expansion meets resistance. Like heaven’s energy blocked by earth, this represents the temporary cessation of flow that precedes necessary transformation.*
>
> -   *In the tholonic system, this hexagram represents the point where energy meets maximum resistance, creating potential for transformation. It demonstrates how consciousness can work with obstruction to create new pathways. From a tholonic perspective, “Stagnation” is perceived as the meeting of creative force with resistance. This scenario is an inherent occurrence within the cycles of expansion and limitation.*

The only point where all the elements (FIRE, WATER, AIR, EARTH) meet is along the side mapped to hexagram 64䷿*~42~* **Before Completion**, which is the last hexagram in the King Wen sequence, and is the inverse, or *descending* version of the “perfect” hexagram of 63䷾*~21~* **After Completion** where all the yin values are in yin positions, and yang values in yang positions, making it naturally *ascending*. The other two hexagrams along this axis are:

42䷩*~49~* **Increase**, “*Sacrifice on the part of those above for the increase of those below.*”

31䷞*~28~* **Wooing**,  “*… their powers attract each other so that they unite.*”

## Binary Tholons

There is another way we can map the lines to a tholon, and that is simply by aligning the 6 lines of a hexagram to the 6 edges of a tetrahedron.


<center><img src='../Images/line-tetra.png' style='width:70%'/></center>

For the large outer triad, we start with the 1<sup>st</sup> vector, or edge and move clockwise. For the inner triad, we continue with the 4<sup>th</sup> line and move counter-clockwise, in the reverse direction. In the image above, each edge is assigned an I-Ching line position. Immediately you can see a few interesting relationships:

-   All opposing numbers equal 7.
-   The central lines of a hexagram, 2 and 5, and the central lines of tetrahedron.
-   The parent (1,3) is yang that creates a yin (2) spectrum, and the child (4,6) is a yin that creates a yang (5) spectrum.
-   The total for the yang is 3<sup>2</sup> (=9), and the total for the yin is 2<sup>2</sup>×3 (=12).
-   As a tetrahedron, it nicely positions all the yang lines central and foundational. However, it is not the obvious central triad that acts as the base of the tetrahedron, but the top triad. This is because it is the top triad of every 2D tholon map that always maintains the same pattern as the parent. This detail ensures that individual tholons have an orientation, but when the thologram is folded into itself, every side can act as any side.


<center><img src='../Images/pyramid-bottom.png' style='width:60%'/></center>

-   ~~Notice how all the yin lines extend from the base to create the integrating 4<sup>th</sup> point, or *white dot*, at the top.~~
-   ~~There are 4 triads created in this 2D tholon defined by the edges; lower right (2,4,1), center (4,5,6), lower left (3,6,2), and top (1,3,5). These create the 4 sides of the tetrahedron. These 4 sides naturally define 4 trigrams, <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b04.png' style='width:30px'/> (4), <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b02.png' style='width:30px'/> (2), <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b01.png' style='width:30px'/> (1), and <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b07.png' style='width:30px'/> (7), respectfully. Notice how the first three have yangs in the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> position, and the 4<sup>th</sup> trigram has yangs in all 3 positions, in other words, the first 3 equal the 4<sup>th</sup> as 4+2+1=7. This would have to be the case if the point where they meet at the top, the *white dot*, had to contain all the properties of each contributing line. The values of these trigrams are the VI values, *values of instantiation*. However, if we look at their OI values as well, we see that 2 of these trigrams are the only 2 trigrams that have the same OI and VI values, those being <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b02.png' style='width:30px'/>(2) and <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b07.png' style='width:30px'/> (7). The other 2 trigrams, <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b04.png' style='width:30px'/> (4) and <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b01.png' style='width:30px'/> (1), also happen to be the mirror versions of each other. If we look at the OI/VI Chart above, we’ll see that these 4 pairs define each of the 3 axis required to create a tholonic trigram. This alone is interesting, but even more so how these three OI/VI pairs, 1-4, 2-2, 7-7, also implicitly define all trigrams.~~

## Hexagrams

With the hexagrams in their binary order we can put together the 64 hexagrams (below).  Some of the hexagrams are identified as being made of trigrams that are:  <img src='../Images/trigram_colors.png' style='width:25%'/>

There are 2 pairs of *scope* hexagrams which are those that are a product of those trigrams that define the scope. These are the *north-south* trigrams <img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB63.png' style='width:30px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB56.png' style='width:30px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB07.png' style='width:30px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB00.png' style='width:30px'/>.

There are 2 pairs of *context* hexagrams which are a product of the trigrams that define the context, or movement within that scope. These are the *east-west* trigrams <img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB45.png' style='width:30px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB42.png' style='width:30px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB21.png' style='width:30px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB18.png' style='width:30px'/>.

There are 8 pairs *transitional* hexagrams which are a product of the transitional trigrams <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b01.png' style='width:30px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b03.png' style='width:30px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b04.png' style='width:30px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b06.png' style='width:30px'/>.

The remaining 20 pairs are a mixture of dissimilar trigrams.


<center><img src='../Images/64hexagrams-4.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

Each quadrant contains 16 hexagrams, but if we were to map these to the four sides of a tetrahedron, we would need exactly 15 hexagrams for a side. The hexagram 0 <img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB00.png' style='width:30px'/> and 63 <img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB63.png' style='width:30px'/> could easily be placed outside the side of the tetrahedron as neither of them represents something that can actually exist. They represent the primary poles within which everything comes into being. That still leaves 2 hexagrams too many. Another problem was; with the hexagrams laid out, whatever hexagrams occupied the three corners, they had to equal 63 so as to be able to form the 4<sup>th</sup> *white dot* point. It turned out that the solution to one problem automatically solved the other problem.


<center><img src='../Images/tetrahex.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

--- TO HERE

Here, we place the 63 <img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB63.png' style='width:30px'/> at the originating N-source, and its opposite, 0 <img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB00.png' style='width:30px'/>, at the child N-source. Because the two side mid-points are actually the children of the child N-source they are outside the scope of the parent so we don’t need to consider them when just looking at the parent. We know that the two children must equal the parent, and while there are 31 possible pairs that together equal the parent’s value of 63, only two of them were cardinal; those are are 56 **Standstill** <img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB56.png' style='width:30px'/> and 7 **Peace** <img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB07.png' style='width:30px'/>. Additionally, these are the only two other hexagrams that are composed of the the two extreme trigrams.

At first glance this arrangement looks very promising, as the cardinal (blue-framed) hexagrams hold cardinal positions and the three corners equal 63 (actually, a multiple of 63, as 56+7+63 = 63×2). Arguably, hex 0 and hex 63 could be reversed, but the results are effectively the same.

However, several other validating patterns emerged that were pretty astounding.


<center><img src='../Images/tetrahex-hex-triplet-3.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

Notice that every value can be defined by a formula that only uses the first 4 prime numbers, or is itself a prime number! It was also a nice surprise that the sum of all values in the central tholonic trigram was 216, or 6×6×6 (see *New Data* chapter in [Appendix C, “Tholonic Math”](https://claude.ai/chat/288f98a1-eaf2-4691-a409-783d66b8eb89#Appendix-C:-Tholonic-Math)).

Notice how each of the four triangular sections (in ***Fig. h3a***, and by implication, ***Fig.h3***) have values that exist within each triangle as either red-framed *moving* or green-framed *transitional* values, i.e. hexagrams 36, *Keeping Still* <img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB36.png' style='width:30px'/>, 27, *Joyous* <img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB27.png' style='width:30px'/>, 21, *After Completion* <img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB21.png' style='width:30px'/>, and 42, *Before Completion* <img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB42.png' style='width:30px'/>.

If we were to create a sequence of the I-Ching based on the Tholonic model above, it would look like the following image:


<center><img src='../Images/t-sequence.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

Some interesting points regarding the above sequence:

Because the 4 cardinal points define the framework and do not make up the dynamic part of the circle, there are exactly 60 points on the circle.

This is just like the ancient Babylonian clock which introduced the idea of the 60 second minute and the 60 minute hour. The modern argument is that they used 360 as a basis because it represented their estimate for the number of days in a year, but this lazy reasoning presumes the ancient Babylonians, who were the masters in their day of navigation, architecture, agriculture, astronomy and government, never bothered to actually count the days in a year, or worse, just ignored the extra days at the end. The reason the ancients used 60 is because 60 is one of the most fundamental numbers that drives nature, given that it is the product of the first three primes… 2<sup>2</sup>×3×5. p.s. 2<sup>2</sup>×3 =12, which is why we have a pair of 12 hours to the day, just like the Ancient Egyptians and Chinese developed. I will save you the embarrassingly myopic explanation offered by traditional modern thinking as to why and how these two cultures came up with the same system.

While the numbers are not sequential, each pair of opposites equal 63.

I have added the octal (base 8) value because it is far more clear. Base-8, if you are not familiar with it, is simply a number system that is based on the eight values 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7. This means when you are counting and you get to 8 you have to start with the double digits, so our base-10 number 8 in octal is written as “10”.


<center><img src='../Images/decoct.png' style='width:70%'/></center>

The beauty of using octal numbers for the I-Ching is the number itself is telling you what trigrams it’s made of. For example hexagram 12 (001100) is octal **o**14 (we use ‘o’ for octal numbers). Hexagram 12 is composed of two trigrams: 001 and 100. We convert from binary to octal; b001 = o1, and b100 = o4. Then we simply put the two numbers next to each other to get o14. This ability to add numbers just by putting them together only works with when converting binary base<sub>2</sub>, octal base<sub>8</sub>, hexadecimal base<sub>16</sub>, base<sub>32</sub>, or base that is a power of 2. Perhaps that is why some ancient Native American and Proto-Indo-European cultures chose to use the octal system.

Numbers are not as intuitive as images, so here are a couple of charts that clearly shows the self-similarity trigram-ish pattern of the sequence. Both of these plots plot the series in each of the quadrants of the tholonic I-Ching which makes its binary and tholonically fractal nature clear.

## Cross-Models: Astrology and the I-Ching

The fundamental structure that the I-Ching and related Eastern thinking is built on is essentially the same as the model for astrology and related Western thinking. This is not at all surprising as both cultures were observing the same laws and patterns in action. However, if we find where they combine and overlap, we can understand one model that encompasses both.

In astrology, each sign is assigned an element property of FIRE, EARTH, AIR or WATER, and a characteristic of Cardinal, Fixed, or Mutable. This makes 12 signs. It might seem that the 6 lines of the I-Ching/thologram would fit neatly into 12, which it does, but if we want to understand that why’s and how’s, we have to go deeper. The first requirement for association is not only do the 6 lines have to map to 12 signs, but the 12 signs need to be mapped to a complete tholon, which is a tholon map and its virtual double.

We start by assigning the most fundamental concepts of the I-Ching, which are are 1 <img src='../Images/bc/yang.png' style='width:35px'/> and 0 <img src='../Images/bc/yin.png' style='width:35px'/> and their virtual counterparts, to the most fundamental signs of the astrology, which are the cardinal signs in the following manner:

**Cardinals**

*Contribution/Definition* is the tholonic polarity that creation exists within. Aires is the first fire sign and only cardinal fire sign is mapped to *Contribution*. Fire is the definition of contribution as it gives at a cost to itself. Fire is the contribution of light and heat at the sacrifice of that which keep it alive. Capricorn, a cardinal earth sign, is ruled by the Great Limiter itself, Saturn, so there is no question that it fits in the space of *Definition* quite nicely. Aires and Capricorn are not opposite to each other, but they are the most dissimilar to each other and are perpendicular to each other. They represent two different dimensions. In this case the X-axis is the axis of 0 <img src='../Images/bc/yin.png' style='width:35px'/> and the Y-axis is the axis of 1 <img src='../Images/bc/yang.png' style='width:35px'/>.

The virtual counterpart to Aires, or the reflection of Aires energy, is Libra, the sign of equilibrium and balance. This is poetically satisfying as the act of fire is the process of a transformation that ends in balance. This is the spectrum or axis of ***I Am↔I Balance*** The virtual counterpart of Capricorn is the nurturing and protective Cancer, which created the ***I Use↔I Feel*** axis.

**Fixed and Mutable**

Leo, like the sun that rules it, is the instantiation of fire, and like all instances it is limited by its context; think sun vs. campfire. Its virtual counterpart is the world changing, innovative Aquarius. This is the ***I Will↔I Know*** spectrum.

Taurus consuming nature’s counterpart is the penetrating Scorpio. This is the ***I Have↔I Desire*** spectrum.

The counterpart to the wise Sagittarius is the witty Gemini, creating the ***I Understand↔I Think***

The counterpart to the analytical Virgo is the edge-surfing Pisces, creating the ***I Analyze↔I Believe*** spectrum.


<center><img src='../Images/astrigridv2_1.png' style='width:80%'/></center>

In the above chart, we assign the same yin/yang values for the elements and tholonic descriptions as we have been using all along. NEGOTIATION has no value (because it is both values combined). In the lower left of each cell is the binary value (and the decimal equivalent) of the the column and row. On the left 2 columns, we have 6 cells made up of 2 primary lines, and 4 cells made up of bigrams. The right is the inverse equivalent, which is consistent with the scheme of duality which exists in both models.

We have to decide in what order the binary values should be assigned. For example, column EARTH and roe DEFINITION has a value of either 10 or 01, depending on which comes first, the column of the row. How do we choose the order? The first thing to understand is that either order is correct, as they are two different perspectives of the same thing. In our case, we want to select the order that displays the most symmetry and coherence.

<img src='../Images/math2.png' style='float:right;width:20%'/>If list the vales as col/row vs. row/col we see that the col/row values have a more symmetry and pattern that the row/col values. For this reason we will use col/row method in order to find their position in the tholon (below left). The right (below) image shows the astrological associations based on those numbers, as we described above. The signs that are only 1 <img src='../Images/bc/yang.png' style='width:35px'/> and 0 <img src='../Images/bc/yin.png' style='width:35px'/> form the 4 outside boundaries, and the bigrams are contained inside the tholon.


<center><img src='../Images/tho-ast-bin.png' style='width:80%'/></center>

The cardinal signs, which only have one line (1 <img src='../Images/bc/yang.png' style='width:35px'/> and 0 <img src='../Images/bc/yin.png' style='width:35px'/>) and are all the NEGOTIATION signs, neatly fit perfectly. For example, the left side of the upper tholon is made up of EARTH-FIRE-EARTH, and the one boundary they all share is the cardinal EARTH sign of Capricorn. Additionally, the diagonal axis that crosses into the virtual (lower) tholon is the boundary between Leo and Taurus which are equidistant to the Capricorn cusp. This axis crosses into the lower right area of the virtual tholon, which is AIR-AIR-WATER, and is between Gemini and Aquarius, also equidistant from their common border of cardinal AIR sign of Libra. This is the pattern we see for all four quadrants. Also significant is that the NEGOTIATION signs, which are those of the that come from the N-state create the spectrum capable of creating new children, not only form the outer boundary, but all non-N signs converge to the tholonic N-cluster in the middle of the resulting hexagrams, creating the central N-state.

<img src='../Images/zodiac.png' style='float:right;width:50%'/>An historically interesting observation is the two central triangles that connect in the center are Leo and Aquarius. Looking at a zodiac, this would appear to be “off”, for why would such a critically significant intersection of central signs appear so asymmetrical? In fact, it is quite symmetrical when you look at the original layout of the astrological chart when there were only 6 planets. Perhaps the original designers designed it this way to ensure that planet earth would be exactly where the perpendicular axis would be, between Venus and Mars, placing earth in the center. This could only be the case if they knew that the planets were heliocentric, which wasn’t discovered until 1609, an was not well-received (astrology dates back to 2000 B.C.).

What symmetry/asymmetry dots show us is that the I-Ching/tholon are aligned to the cosmic, not the planet, because the asymmetry is only relative to planet Earth due to the fact that the vernal equinox takes place on March 21 and we mark that as the beginning of the cycles of seasons. To be symmetrical in both contexts, spring would have to arrive on December 21. By tholonic logic the most likely ‘starting point’ would be the at the top of the tholon, Virgo, which is August 23.

One minor difference between the western and eastern models is that while they both reflect and invert to create the complete picture, they do it a little differently, which makes a perfect mapping difficult with the existing models. Here is a larger scale of one type of iteration. Looking at the monogram and bigram numbers of the signs as they progress there does not seem to be much of a pattern; 1, 2, 1, 0, 3, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 3, 0.


<center><img src='../Images/zodgrid.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

However, if we arrange them in a circle, and color them to represent the *Negotiation*, *Definition*, *Contribute* elements, the tholonic and binary information becomes quite clear.


<center><img src='../Images/numberwheel.png' style='width:50%'/></center>

-   All values are equal to their opposite.
-   The single NEGOTIATION (blue) points, which represent the points from which new children can be produced, are 1 <img src='../Images/bc/yang.png' style='width:35px'/> and 0 <img src='../Images/bc/yin.png' style='width:35px'/>.
-   But there is another set of 1 and 0 which are made of the bigrams <img src='../Images/bc/bigram01.png' style='width:35px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/bigram00.png' style='width:35px'/>, and these represent the CONTRIBUTE (red) points, which are the points that return to the N-state, so 1s and 0s leave the N-state as a single line of 0 or 1, yin or yang, but return to the N-state as a bigram also of 0 or 1, yin or yang.
-   The 2s <img src='../Images/bc/bigram10.png' style='width:35px'/> and 3s <img src='../Images/bc/bigram11.png' style='width:35px'/> occupy the DEFINING (green) points and only appear once, unlike the 1/0s. 3 represents the most energized, or extreme yang state, and is that same axis that divides the planets in the traditional astrological layout.

## The Lines

*Note: Except for the graphic at the end of this chapter, the red and blue text used below is not related to the RGB colors of the tholon as has been used up until now. They were chosen for their ease of readability and contrast*.

There is another reason why we bring up astrology, and that is because, as we can see in the number wheel above and the tholon model, it is based on six pairs of attributes that define and describe a complete journey through the cycle, and which happen to map neatly onto the six lines of change in the I-Ching. If we apply the rules of the tholonic I-Ching and binary models to astrology, we get the chart shown below.


<center><img src='../Images/tho-zod.png' style='width:70%'/></center>

It works like this… All blue characters are YANG in nature, and all red are YIN. All yellow backgrounds are INNER in nature and correspond to the REAL or upper trigram of the tholon, and all green backgrounds are OUTER and correspond to the VIRTUAL or lower trigram of the tholon. We can see that for a specific context each tholonic property has four states, for example, NEGOTIATION in the context of NATURE can be *Active, Nurturing, Harmonious* or *Ambitious*. These states represent the INNER-YANG, INNER-YIN, OUTER-YANG, and OUTER-YIN. Of these four states, the default (in bold) INNER-YIN is *Nurturing*, and the default OUTER-YANG is *Harmony*. A property in a context is default when the nature of the value is the same as the nature of the context, so, a yin value in a yin context is the default value for that context.

Here is how we want to look at this graph as it applies to the hexagram.


<center><img src='../Images/tho-zod-2.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

To validate this we can look at a few details, such as how the progression of the *Nature* column fits perfectly (in my humble opinion) for both the inner (yellow) and outer (green) definitions.

-   INCEPTION requires Harmony.
-   SPECIFICATIONS must be consistent.
-   DEPLOYMENT requires knowing what and where something will be deployed.
-   EMERGENCE requires Nurturing, for it is fraught with challenges and demands.
-   SYNTHESIS requires the creation is useful.
-   DIFFUSION is the ultimate *Practicality*, as returning to the source is not only the end of the cycle, but the absolutely one thing nothing that exists can escape.

Let’s make this even simpler to illustrate another point.


<center><img src='../Images/tho-zod-3.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

Looking at the 0/1 value of the yin/yang quality of the lines and properties, you can see (bolded) the yin (0) values that exist within the yellow/yin side are the values that are the natural archetypes for that place. The same is true for the 1 values inside the green/yang side. Hexagram 21 (binary value) is the hexagram where every yin line exists in a yin place, and every yang line exists in a yang place. Hex 21 is the ideal archetype of a hexagram, and its opposite, hex 42, is the reverse, or inverted, or “negative image” archetype. If we were to apply the above charts to hex 21 and 42 using the values from the *Nature* and *Personal* columns, we would get the following.


<center><img src='../Images/tho-zod-4.png' style='width:80%'/></center>

This shows that, according to the Tholonic model using traditionally Western values, the archetype of INCEPTION is *Harmony*, and its inverted concept, *Activity*. Likewise, on a more individual, subjective front, the archetype of INCEPTION is *I Balance*, and its inverted concept, *I Am*. Looking at all the pairs we see the same well-matched dualities.

There is still one last step, and that is to reduce the twelve pairs down to six pairs. This is fairly easy, and it looks something like the left image in the graph below. We have added the blue text circle to describe the qualities of the pair of the previously opposing six pairs, or twelve attributes, of Western astrology. It’s obvious how these 6 *uber* attributes match well with the pink circle that lists the I-Ching’s attributes for the 6 lines.

On the right is the previous graph that describe the eight trigrams. Here we have together the model for trigrams and the model for the lines. The lines model (left) is based on the *tholonic tree*, where we begin with 1, which creates 2 more, which is mirrored, creating 6, and then inverted, which creates 12. The trigram model (right) is a *binary tree*, beginning with 1, which creates 2, each of which creates 2 (4) each of which creates 2 (8).

Both of these models describe only the structure, the contexts of which is constantly changing.


<center><img src='../Images/astro-pakua.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

With all that we have learned so far, let’s attempt to decipher and translate the I-Ching. This will be Part II of this book, “*The Way of Change*”, when its draft version is ready to be published. Currently it is a work in progress unfit for even draft publishing.

# Section IV: Synthesis

## How Creation Works

We are going to zoom way out now to get an even broader, but more in-depth picture of the natural processes in play in the hopes it will add insight into how we reconstruct the I-Ching.

The Tholonic model is based on the ancient premise that from a singularity comes a duality. We see this in the idea that *nothingness* has no value until *something* appears within it, at which point, *nothingness* is represented as 0, and *somethingness* is represented as 1. Without something, nothing would ever exist, because… its nothingness only exists in contrast to something. We’ll avoid the unsolvable argument of which came first, nothingness or somethingness, other than to say that prior to the appearance of something, the question of whether nothing existed is irrelevant.

So now we have 1 and 0. What can we say about these two numbers? We can say that they are two parts of a duality, and because we know that the sum of the parts of a whole equal the whole, we can then say that 1+0=1, which tells us the whole equals 1. This sounds like 1<sup>st</sup> grade math… but let’s continue.

We can plot this a few different ways:


<center><img src='../Images/numbers-1_1.png' style='width:50%'/></center>

If this is a true statement, then it must be true for all numbers. Let’s try this with the first, and only the first, 8 numbers, 0-7, by making every pair of numbers that equals 7; 7+0, 6+1, 5+2, and 4+3, just like how the original pair of opposites, 1 and 0, equal the value of the parent, which *must* be 1.


<center><img src='../Images/numbers-1_2.png' style='width:80%'/></center>

Now we have a problem, because, as is shown in the above 1-level tree chart, we have four 7s, which when split make all the numbers 0-7, but what then are the two parents of these 7s? If we apply the same logic, then those four 7s would have the two parents of 14 (**o**16) and 14 (**o**16), making the originating parent 28 (**o**46), but this is not allowed as we have no numbers that are greater than 7. The problem is that any number we use as a parent number will never create two children that are the same number because the parent number *must* be odd to create different children. In addition, if the top number is even, the number of possible pairs is an odd number. For example, if 6 is the parent, we have 4 possible child pairs of 0-6, 1-5, 2-4, and 3-3, but 3-3 is not allowed as they are the same number, leaving 3 pairs. This breaks the binary symmetry, and we assume that this symmetry is a requirement based on the fact that the first number to represent something, 1, creates perfect symmetry.

The problem then is that there is no number that can be used to represent the parents. So, we have to invent some numbers. This is done all the time in math, for example *imaginary numbers* and even *pure imaginary numbers*. These are numbers like *i*, the square root of -1. Let’s invent some imaginary numbers, but let’s call them *primordial numbers*.


<center><img src='../Images/number-chart.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

We need a number that can be equal to two (or more) values that are never equal to each other. This is a familiar concept in quantum mechanics where we have the idea of spin and entanglement. For an excellent and clear explanation of this subject, see Quantum Magazine’s “Entanglement Made Simple”.

We can now apply to this idea to our tree of 7, going all the way to the top, where we have the meta-value, or *first order primordial number*, of A, which represents one unit from which these eight numbers emerge from in the following manner.


<center><img src='../Images/numbers-1_3.png' style='width:80%'/></center>

We start with A and its pair, which consists of A<sub>0</sub> and A<sub>1</sub>. On the next row, each one of those meta-values has its own pair, so A<sub>0</sub> has A<sub>01</sub> (sub 1 of sub 0) and A<sub>00</sub>, etc.

*Note: Don’t be confused if you are looking at the binary sub-indexes and seeing they do not match the decimal values. They are not suppose to be the same. This is explained in the next paragraphs.*

To represent this in circular charts, we need a new chart for each row.


<center><img src='../Images/numbers-1_4.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

At the bottom of the above tree, we have seven states of A, each identified by the sub-index value representing its lineage from A. If you understand binary numbers you’ll notice that the sub-indexes follow the perfect sequential order of 76543210 (starting from the left), yet the number they represent have a very different order 70615243. This seems to make no logical sense, but in fact, it is an amazing relationship.

<img src='../Images/numbers-1_5_2.png' style='width:100%'/>

The sub-index values represent the path of expression from A, or position within the tree, that resulted in a number value. This is the *order of instantiation*, while the value itself is the *value of instantiation*. Look at how these two sets of values relate to one another. Above (top left) are the binary and decimal values for the *OI* sub-indexes and the value, *VI*, of that number.

In the top right form, the *value of instantiation* (*VI*) axis is perpendicular to the *order of instantiation* (*OI*) axis, not unlike the two waves of electromagnetism. These two axes are perfectly in sync with each other in two different axis and seem to be a natural process of reordering in a very efficient form of encoding (and therefore decoding) as the *value of instantiation* is an encoded version of the *order of instantiation* and visa versa.

The lower right form shows the 4 trigrams made of the parent and 2 children each. We still see the order, but it is in two sets. The lower left image shows how these values could be mapped to a tholon.

Technically speaking (and I need to say that because what comes next sounds quite esoteric), every instance, which is every *thing* that exists, is not only a piece of the *One Thing* that all existence came from, the ultimate A, which tholonically speaking is a 0-dimensional dot, but also a recombination of the very path that caused it to come into existence starting from the dot, the A, at the beginning of creation. If there was only one source from which everything grew from, then every instance, every thing, has a unique *order of instantiation* value which describes the path it has taken from 0-dimensions. Because every order of instantiation is unique, so too is the *value of instantiation*.

But there is one more perspective that is worth looking at. If we arrange this tree in its most natural evolving form (the synergetics of 60°), we get the following:


<center><img src='../Images/honeymap.png' style='width:90%'/></center>

There are many significant patterns here, but the ones I’d like to point out specifically are:

Only the numbers 7 and 2 are the same on both axes. This is significant because it says that the value of 7 and 2 have the same measure when it comes to *how* something came to be, and *what* something came to be. This is not only because they are the same in the map, but they are also the same as the sum of their axis. When we look at the combined values of the axes, we see that this is the same case for the 12. They also are the first and last prime numbers (in the set of 0-8, the two in-between being 3 and 5)

There are three types of lines, one for each axis; the red center line that goes through A, the cyan diagonal line from 2(2) to 2(2), and the green lines which are all 7(7) related.

-   The red line is includes the source value of A and the only instance of a combined child, A<sub>011</sub> and A<sub>100</sub>. This appears to be equivalent to the N-source/N-child axis, or *Negotiation*. The values A<sub>011</sub> and A<sub>100</sub> overlap, and of course, when combined they equal A<sub>111</sub>. In addition, the sums of the *OI* values is the limit of the *order*, 7, and the sums of the *VI* values shows it will express itself (the *value*) as 6, suggesting that the child N-source would have the value of 6, which we have seen is true.
-   The cyan line of 2(2) is the first and only instance that is isolated from any other relationships at the observable level. This is equated to *Definition*.
-   The green line of 7(7) is the final instantiation, being A<sub>111</sub>. It is also the only instance of a single archetype (A<sub>111</sub>) and A. The only other instance that includes A is the combined child of the red line.
-   Values A<sub>011</sub> and A<sub>100</sub> overlap, and of course, when combined they equal A<sub>111</sub>, which is supporting evidence that this model is viable. In addition, the sums of the *OI* values is the limit of the *order*, 7, and the sums of the *VI* values shows it will express itself (the *value*) as 6. This green line is equated to *Contribution*.
-   Also of interest is how the only values that relate to the lines of *Contribution* and *Definition*, which form the spectrum of creation, create an oscillation of 7 points <img src='../Images/honeymapsin.png' style='width:90px'/>, and how the total value of the sub-indexes equals 7×2, or 14 (7+3+1+0+0+1+2), how it is perfectly centered around A.

Only meta-values that reach the *observable level* have some quality that is quantifiable as a number, but as everything beyond that point can have numerical values, the implication is that there are 7 meta-values across 2 generations and 3 levels that stand between A and all instances or numbers. While it can’t be proven, I suspect these 7 meta-values are the source of the “7 heavens” (and the “7 hells” in some cases) legends, myths and beliefs that exist the Abrahamic, Mesopotamian, Gnostic, and Hindu scripture. If nothing else, it’s an interesting ‘coincidence’.

## DNA

We see this same pattern of progression in the most fundamental form of creation; genetics. Below is a graph that illustrates how the bases (adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine) pair together to form nucleotides. An *A* can only double bond with a *T*, and *C* can only triple bond with a *G*. This is accomplished by taking one side, inverting it (a negative image), then reversing it (horizontal flip). When we do that, the pairs automatically line up in their proper order. In the image below we see the same concepts as above by considering the bases of *A,T,G,C* to be the instantiable of some *meta-base*, or some instantiable archetype. These are represented as the half-circles and full circles. We also assign sun-index values representing their paths, and, as you can see, every pair has two values that equals 3.

The intention is to show how at least one aspect of the mechanics of a DNA strand follows the same order, or pattern, of this archetype of *hierarchical primordial numbers* and that of many natural processes, and, of course, the I-Ching. For example, the parent of the bonded bases could be the concept of the class of compounds called purines or pyrimidines. Their parent, the source, could be the class of aromatic heterocyclic organic compounds, which all the children are a member of. Or perhaps it could be *Chargaff’s Rule*, which states “DNA must have equal parts of GC and AT nucleotides”. There could be many different instances of these parents, but in every case (where this model is applied), they will follow the same pattern of expression.


<center><img src='../Images/dna-clr.png' style='width:80%'/></center>

This inverting and reversing is the exact same process used in the I-Ching and shows how only 16 original hexagrams are needed to create 64. What is especially interesting is how the opposite (inverted and flipped) of the purine compound of adenine is the pyrimidine compound of thymine. This is interesting because there can’t really be an “opposite” of a compound or molecule or atom, but there can be two compounds that perform in an “opposite” manner in one context or task, and this “opposite” will typically appear as “complementary”. In another context or task these compounds would act in a very different manner, such as how adenine is used in cellular metabolism to transfer chemical energy between chemical reactions. From a tholonic perspective, this shows that the structure of a process is independent of the instances that attempt to apply that process, which also then suggests that the process archetype existed before it was instantiated.

There are correlations between the I-Ching and DNA. For example, if we replace DNA concepts with I-Ching concepts, we can say the following:


<center><img src='../Images/iching-dna.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

## Elements

In keeping with the traditional I-Ching, we want to assign familiar real-world elements and properties. Using archetypes to describe a scene or function can be very helpful in tapping into our intuitive understanding. The traditional elements of the I-Ching are: water, fire, wood, metal and earth. These elements are traditionally said to work together in a sort of paper/rock/scissor manner:

> Wood generates Fire, Fire generates Earth, Earth generates Metal, Metal generates Water and Water generates Wood.
>
> Wood weakens Water, Water weakens Metal, Metal weakens Earth, Earth weakens Fire and Fire weakens Wood.
>
> Wood controls Earth, Earth controls Water, Water controls Fire, Fire controls Metal and Metal controls Wood.
>
> Wood insults Metal, Metal insults Fire, Fire insults Water, Water insults Earth and Earth insults Wood.

However, we are using Western *primordial* elements here as they are a better fit and are more flexible in general. For the cardinal points, we have the four classics of AIR, WATER, EARTH, and FIRE. We use all caps for these archetypes to distinguish them from the physical elements. These archetypes represent qualities and properties of the elements that can be found in anything, and not simply the physical instances of air, water, earth, and fire.

To expand on this a bit, the *other* classic set of Western elements is referred to as the alchemical principles, which are salt, mercury, and sulfur, which also happen to be perfect representations of the three types of chemical bonding; ionic, metallic, and covalent. But the alchemists are missing the 4<sup>th</sup> property which is needed to create a tetrahedron. There actually is a 4<sup>th</sup> type of chemical bonding called *hydrogen bonding*, and it happens to be the type of bond that holds water together. In any case, these three properties are well covered in the four classics; EARTH as salt (ionic bonds), WATER as mercury (metallic bonds), and FIRE as sulfur (covalent bonds), and I guess AIR would then be, ironically, water… with it’s hydrogen bonds? Well, until the Royal Society of Alchemists, or whoever is in charge of alchemists, figures this out and comes up with an updated model, we’ll stick with the traditional and classic elements.

We have also adopted the astrological/Neo-Platonic qualities of these elements. Of course, any other definitions could be used to create interpretation that are consistent with other perspectives.


<center><img src='../Images/elements.png' style='width:80%'/></center>

Here are the explanations of the cardinal and transitional elements with their reasoning and correlation with the triads.

### ***EARTH***

<img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b00.png' style='width:60px'/> 0

*EARTH* represents the foundation upon which everything is built as well as the resources from which they are built. It is cardinal, winter solstice, inward, the non-moving point between deflation and inflation. Instances of this are **resources**, **foundations**, **support**.

The trigram shows the symbol of a perfect yin state.

The quadrant of EARTH <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b00.png' style='width:30px'/> exists between the dynamic properties of *Emptying* <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b04.png' style='width:30px'/> and *Filling* <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b01.png' style='width:30px'/> and therefore represent the extreme yin pole, where the maximum point of *Emptying* is reached and where *Filling* begins.

1.  *Negotiation*: <img src='../Images/bc/yin.png' style='width:30px'/> A yin here indicates that anything can be negotiated, for it is receptive to anything, yin or yang.
2.  *Definition*: <img src='../Images/bc/yin.png' style='width:30px'/> The emerging definitions are determined by whatever is acting upon it.
3.  *Contribution*: <img src='../Images/bc/yin.png' style='width:30px'/> The contribution of the yin is that it allows a yang to appear simply by its existence. It doesn’t need to do anything, just as 0 implies 1 by its nothingness, similar to how *0<sup>0</sup>*, or *nothingness<sup>nothingness</sup>*, = 1.

### ***WATER***

<img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b02.png' style='width:60px'/> 2

*WATER* represents the movement from dark to light, yin to yang, lifelessness to life. It is cardinal, spring equinox, ascending, the perfect balance of lessening yin and increasing yang. Instances of this are **electricity**, **nourishment**, **cleansing**, **rivers**.

The quadrant of WATER<img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b02.png' style='width:30px'/> exists between the dynamic properties of *Filling* <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b01.png' style='width:30px'/> and *Collecting* <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b03.png' style='width:30px'/> and represents the balance between the yin and yang that is achieved when yang penetrates the yin at is center. The oceans and lakes have filled and are stagnant until the rivers form which serves to collect the water to return it to its source. It is the most *inward* moving of all the states.

The trigram shows the symbol of yang energy penetrating the yin at its core.

1.  *Negotiation*: <img src='../Images/bc/yin.png' style='width:30px'/> Water cedes to whatever holds it.
2.  *Definition*: <img src='../Images/bc/yang.png' style='width:30px'/> The movement of water is what gives it its power.
3.  *Contribution*: <img src='../Images/bc/yin.png' style='width:30px'/> It is the yielding quality of water that is its contribution. It always follows the path of least resistance, is used by every form of life and Nature itself, and is then returned, essentially unchanged. It takes nothing, and gives everything. It is the nature of growth and expansion.

### ***AIR***

<img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b07.png' style='width:60px'/> 7

*AIR* represents the arena of growth and creation. What comes from the yin EARTH grows *into* the yang AIR. It holds all things in the Universe in place and is symbolic of spirit, which shows us a life expanding beyond our earthly limitations. It is cardinal, summer solstice, outward, the non-moving point between inflation and deflation. Instance of this are **birth**, **exploration**, **imagination**.

The trigram shows the symbol of a perfect yang state. AIR is one of the three trigrams that is an ORIGINATING SOURCE.

The quadrant of AIR <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b07.png' style='width:30px'/> exists between the dynamic properties of *Collecting* <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b03.png' style='width:30px'/> and *Releasing* <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b06.png' style='width:30px'/> and therefore represents the turning point from the internal journey to the external journey. This is the extreme yang pole, where the maximum point of *Collecting* is reached and the *Releasing* must soon begin.

1.  *Negotiation*: <img src='../Images/bc/yang.png' style='width:30px'/> It is the nature of air to move and to create; it therefore seeks out the yin.
2.  *Definition*: <img src='../Images/bc/yang.png' style='width:30px'/> While the unknown is yin in nature, exploring it is yang, and it is only by exploring that definitions and limitations are discovered.
3.  *Contribution*: <img src='../Images/bc/yang.png' style='width:30px'/> The contribution of AIR is to open new doors and find new horizons.

### ***FIRE***

<img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b05.png' style='width:60px'/> 5

*FIRE* represents the quality that allows for manifestation, transforming idea to form. It is cardinal, fall equinox, descending, the perfect balance of lessening yang and increasing yin. Instance of this are **light**, **consumption**.

The trigram shows the symbol of a yang on the outside but dependent on a yin center as the yang dissipates, much like a fire that shines light as the log is reduced to ashes.

The quadrant of FIRE <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b05.png' style='width:30px'/> exists between the dynamic properties of *Release* <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b06.png' style='width:30px'/> and *Emptying* <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b04.png' style='width:30px'/> and therefore represents the dissipation of energy, which brings form into existence and light into the world. This is the balance that represents the zenith of outward expression.

1.  *Negotiation*: <img src='../Images/bc/yang.png' style='width:30px'/> The yang is built up and is ready to be released.
2.  *Definition*: <img src='../Images/bc/yin.png' style='width:30px'/> The yin returns as the yang is released, which is defined by dissipation and entropy.
3.  *Contribution*: <img src='../Images/bc/yang.png' style='width:30px'/> The energy is shared with the world, as light, heat, and movement.

Here are the explanations of the transitional or dynamic interactions.

### ***Release*** (AIR & FIRE)

<img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b06.png' style='width:60px'/> 6

*Release* represents accumulated energy that seeks balance, and in the process of balancing itself, dissipates itself and its recipient. It is the initial outward movement that leads to expression. Instances of this are **lightning**, **Big Bang**, **inspiration**.

The trigram shows the symbol of yin energy re-entering the solid yang. The new yin line comes in at the lowest position of beginning, birth, idea. The yang is still dominant as the middle line is still yang, so the transition is yang in nature.

The quadrant of AIR <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b07.png' style='width:30px'/> and FIRE <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b05.png' style='width:30px'/> is one of outward-descending, or external yang. Here, the yang pole of the limits of sustainability has been reached, so there will be a natural movement in the opposite direction. When this extreme yang mixes with the yin there is a powerful release of yang energy, and the result is FIRE. This quadrant is *outward* because the process of creation is that of energy (yang) taking form (yin), and form exists in the outer world. *Descending* because the yang expands, and by doing so also dissipates itself.

1.  *Negotiation*: <img src='../Images/bc/yin.png' style='width:30px'/> When the yang energy becomes complete, not only does it have nowhere left to go, but its existence depends on the yin at this point. Here, the yang is subservient to the yin.
2.  *Definition*: <img src='../Images/bc/yang.png' style='width:30px'/> When yang meets yin it wants to release all of its energy and pushes against the limitations of the yin.
3.  *Contribution*: <img src='../Images/bc/yang.png' style='width:30px'/> The yang finds expression in FIRE as it consumes the yin.

### ***Emptying*** (FIRE & EARTH)

<img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b04.png' style='width:60px'/> 4

*Emptying* represents the dissipation and movement of energy via matter. It is the source of order out of chaos. It is the final outward deflation that returns to the initial chaos from which everything is born. Instances of this are **music**, **creation of the elements**, **death**.

The trigram shows the yin energy overtaking the center, making this trigram yin in nature. *Emptying* is one of the three trigrams that is an ORIGINATING SOURCE.

The quadrant of FIRE <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b05.png' style='width:30px'/> and EARTH <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b00.png' style='width:30px'/> is one of final descension, or external yin, where the energy of FIRE quickly dies. This is external because it is FIRE transitioning to EARTH, and *descending* because the energy of creation is waning in the process. This is the process that transforms energy to mass (*m=E/c<sup>2</sup>*).

1.  *Negotiation*: <img src='../Images/bc/yin.png' style='width:30px'/> In the dynamic between FIRE and EARTH, FIRE is always dependent on EARTH.
2.  *Definition*: <img src='../Images/bc/yin.png' style='width:30px'/> FIRE can only find expression in EARTH, just like energy can only be experienced via matter. Therefore, the limitations on the expression of FIRE are determined by the yin quality of EARTH.
3.  *Contribution*: <img src='../Images/bc/yang.png' style='width:30px'/> The restructuring of matter (EARTH) by energy (FIRE) is what brings everything into existence.

### ***Filling*** (EARTH & WATER)

<img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b01.png' style='width:60px'/> 1

*Filling* represents form coming to life. It is the initial inward inflation of a new cycle. Instance of this are **gestation**, **dark matter (expansion of the Universe)**, **artificial intelligence**.

This trigram shows the return of the yang energy in the bottom place, but as the center is still yin, it is in the domain of yin. *Filling* is one of the three trigrams that is an ORIGINATING SOURCE.

The quadrant of EARTH <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b00.png' style='width:30px'/> and WATER <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b01.png' style='width:30px'/> is one of new beginnings, or internal yin, where the empty yin state of EARTH begins to return to life with energy. It is inward because the yang enters from the lowest place, and ascending because the yang continues to rise.

1.  *Negotiation*: <img src='../Images/bc/yang.png' style='width:30px'/> The lack of yang is what draws the yang to penetrate the EARTH
2.  *Definition*: <img src='../Images/bc/yin.png' style='width:30px'/> The yang must fill the empty yin vessel of EARTH before it can express itself.
3.  *Contribution*: <img src='../Images/bc/yin.png' style='width:30px'/> The omnipresence of yang is the universal reservoir that can be tapped into from anywhere, not unlike the idea of the earth as the electrical ground for all electronics.

### ***Collecting*** (WATER & AIR)

<img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b03.png' style='width:60px'/> 3

*Collecting* represents the higher orders of structure that extend ever outward. It is the final internal inflation, the final preparation. Instances of this are the **Internet**, **space-born viruses**, **Mongol Empire**.

This trigram, with two emerging yang lines, is now in the domain of the yang.

The quadrant of WATER <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b01.png' style='width:30px'/> and AIR <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b07.png' style='width:30px'/> is one of preparing, or internal yang, where the balanced state of WATER ascends and expands into the polar state of AIR.

1.  *Negotiation*: <img src='../Images/bc/yang.png' style='width:30px'/> The yang becomes dominant here, and the remaining yin is outnumbered. This is the time when the yang begins to reign.
2.  *Definition*: <img src='../Images/bc/yang.png' style='width:30px'/> The yang is no longer constrained by the limitation of the EARTH and is free to expand into what seems like limitless AIR. This is the culmination of expression, and whatever the ultimate expression of an instance is, according to the nature of the instance, will be expressed here.
3.  *Contribution*: <img src='../Images/bc/yin.png' style='width:30px'/> What remains of that expression or how it lives on is something only history will know.

## Pi Generation from Tholonic Principles

<img src='../Images/times7.png' style='float:right;width:30%'/>Here is the Python3 code to run the Pi generator, which demonstrates the mathematical relationship between tholonic principles and fundamental constants.  The image on the right is the triad that is used as input values.





```python
def compute_tholonic_pi(max_iter=1000000, tol=1e-10):
    # Initial conditions based on the Tholonic model diagram
    N_k = 1  # Starting value (analogous to N_0 in the diagram)
    h_step = 2  # Increment step for updating sum_d and prod_c in each iteration
    sum_d = 3  # Divisor term d (related to CN = 3 in the diagram)
    prod_c = 5  # Divisor term c (related to ND = 5 in the diagram)
    
    for count in range(max_iter):
        # Refinement step: Update N_k based on division and summation rules
        N_next = N_k - (1 / sum_d) + (1 / prod_c)
    
        # Print progress every 1000 iterations to reduce I/O overhead
        if count % 1000 == 0:
            print(f"Iteration {count}: π approximation = {N_next * 4}")
    
        # Check if the approximation is close enough to π
        if abs(N_next * 4 - 3.141592653589793) < tol:
            print(f"Converged at iteration {count}: π ≈ {N_next * 4}")
            return N_next * 4  # Return the computed approximation of π
    
        # Update values for the next iteration
        N_k = N_next  # Set new N_k for the next step
        sum_d += h_step ** 2  # Increment sum_d (analogous to adding h²)
        prod_c += h_step * 2  # Increment prod_c (analogous to adding 2h)
    
    # If max iterations are reached without convergence
    print("Max iterations reached. Approximate π:", N_k * 4)
    return N_k * 4

# Run the optimized function
compute_tholonic_pi()
```

This program demonstrates how π can be derived through the tholonic relationships discovered in our analysis of the I-Ching. The initial values are taken from the tholonic interpretation of trigrams, particularly the relationships between Negotiation, Definition, and Contribution as mapped to the primary trigram values.

## Tholonic Math

Tholonic mathematics provides a way to understand the relationships between apparent dualities and their resolution into unity. The formulas shown in Section III’s “By the Numbers” section demonstrate how simple divisive operations can generate the fundamental constants π (pi) and φ (phi) from the same numerical pattern observed in the I-Ching.

Some key mathematical relationships observed:

1.  The sum of any triad and its opposite side equals 63
2.  The complete set of cardinal values (0, 2, 5, 7) and dynamic values (1, 3, 4, 6) form complementary patterns
3.  The values inherent in the hexagram mapping (14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56) are all multiples of 7
4.  The relationships between these values can be used to derive fundamental constants through iteration

The discovery that the tholonic triad produces a value of 216 (6×6×6) in the center of the structure suggests a profound relationship to natural harmonic structures, possibly relating to concepts of sacred geometry.

## Technical Specifications for Trigram and Hexagram Relationships

## Trigram Binary Values

-   Earth (坤): 000 - Binary value: 0
-   Mountain (艮): 001 - Binary value: 1
-   Water (坎): 010 - Binary value: 2
-   Thunder (震): 011 - Binary value: 3
-   Wind (巽): 100 - Binary value: 4
-   Fire (離): 101 - Binary value: 5
-   Lake (兌): 110 - Binary value: 6
-   Heaven (乾): 111 - Binary value: 7

## Cardinal vs. Dynamic Trigrams

-   **Cardinal**: Earth (0), Water (2), Fire (5), Heaven (7)
-   **Dynamic**: Mountain (1), Thunder (3), Wind (4), Lake (6)

## Hexagram Formation

To form a hexagram, combine two trigrams where:

-   The lower trigram forms lines 1, 2, and 3 (from bottom to top)
-   The upper trigram forms lines 4, 5, and 6 (from bottom to top)

The binary value of a hexagram is calculated as:

    (Upper trigram binary value × 8) + Lower trigram binary value

## Hexagram Reflection and Inversion

-   **Reflection**: Swap the upper and lower trigrams
-   **Inversion**: Change all lines from yin to yang or yang to yin
-   **Opposition**: Both reflect and invert

## Tholonic Mapping Relations

-   Each corner of a tholon maps to a specific trigram
-   The three sides of a tholonic triad correspond to numerical values that are multiples of 7
-   The interaction between opposing trigrams produces balanced complementary energies
-   The center of a tholonic structure corresponds to hexagram 56 (binary value), representing the balance point of all energies

## New Data: Emergent Mathematical Properties

Further investigation of the tholonic mapping of the I-Ching reveals additional mathematical relationships:

1.  **Numerical Symmetry**: The sum of all positions in a tholonic triad equals 216 (6³), suggesting a fundamental volumetric relationship.
2.  **Prime Number Distribution**: The cardinal values (0, 2, 5, 7) when added to their complements (7, 5, 2, 0) all equal 7, the 4th prime number.
3.  **Fibonacci Relationship**: When the tholonic iteration process used to derive π is modified with the values (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8…), it converges toward φ (the golden ratio).
4.  **Wave Function**: The alternating pattern of yin and yang lines in successive hexagrams forms a sine wave with a period of 6, corresponding to the 6 stages of growth described in the I-Ching.
5.  **Octal Significance**: The interpretation of the I-Ching through base-8 (octal) numbers provides direct mapping of trigrams to their binary values, suggesting that ancient cultures may have recognized this relationship intuitively.

These mathematical properties further support the hypothesis that the I-Ching and Tholonic models are describing universal patterns that extend beyond cultural or philosophical interpretations into the fundamental structure of reality itself.
