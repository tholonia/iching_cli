##### *“Although the words are very clear, yet they are also very vague. The shallow may take the I Ching to be a book of divination, but the profound consider it the secret of the Celestial Mechanism.”*

## A Comprehensive Integration

This book serves as the foreword and introduction to The Tholonic I Ching, but it is published separately because it is far more than a standard introduction. Instead of a brief preface, this book provides a comprehensive overview of two complex models, requiring special explanations; hence its 100+ pages.

Including this material within The Tholonic I Ching would make the book overly cumbersome, adding significant bulk to its already 550 pages. More importantly, this extended introduction would disrupt the book’s aesthetic balance and detract from the reading experience. Additionally, most readers of The Tholonic I Ching may not require or be interested in such an in-depth explanation, making its inclusion unnecessary.

Another reason for publishing this book separately is that both books evolve independently. While The Tholonic I Ching and this introduction are updated regularly, they do not follow the same revision schedule. Keeping them separate ensures that each book can develop at its own pace, allowing for ongoing refinement without disrupting the other.

# Section I: Introduction & Foundations

## Understanding the Purpose

This exploration aims to examine the ancient wisdom of the I Ching through the lens of the Tholonic model, demonstrating not only how this 5,000-year-old system of divination and philosophy aligns with modern understandings of energy, consciousness, and creation, but how it can expand upon and explain the Tholonic model, and vice versa as well. By examining the I Ching’s fundamental concepts of yin and yang, trigrams, and hexagrams within the framework of tholonic principles, we can bridge ancient Eastern wisdom with contemporary Western thought, revealing the universal patterns that underlie all systems of knowledge and existence, which are foundational to the Tholonic model.

## Why the I Ching?

The Tholonic model is compatible with virtually all conceptual models of reality and creation, so why did we single out the choice of the I Ching? Here are just a few of the reasons:

-   **Accessibility:** The *I Ching* is one of the oldest, accessible, and practical models of the creative process available.
-   **Quantifiable Properties:** Its structured system of hexagrams and lines provides quantifiable properties that make it easy to compare with the Tholonic Model.
-   **Historical Significance:** With thousands of years of use and study, the *I Ching* offers a deep well of knowledge for comparative analysis.
-   **Extensive Commentary:** Its rich body of commentary and interpretations adds depth and context, making it an excellent reference point.
-   **Cross-Disciplinary and cross-cultural acceptance:** The I Ching is recognized worldwide, influencing philosophy, religion, art, literature, science, technology, and medicine across Western, Jewish, Islamic, Asian, and East Asian cultures. Its principles are studied at leading universities such as Oxford, Cambridge, Columbia, and Stanford.

Additionally, the *I Ching* shares and predates core principles with several major belief systems, such as Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism, Kabbalah, Hermeticism, Indigenous Wisdom Traditions, Sufism, Judaism, Islam, and Christianity, particularly their emphasis on *balance* and the interplay of opposites, *cyclical transformation* and growth, and the *interconnectedness* of all things.

The Tholonic model and the I Ching also share the axiomatic and quite common principle that everything emerges from and exists within a duality, with the identical intention. While the Tholonic model describes an all-encompassing three-dimensional holarchy of all that can exist in the form of a fractal tetrahedral matrix, the 5,000-year-old legendary and mythical ruler *Fu Xi* created the I Ching to *“become thoroughly conversant with the numinous and bright and to classify the myriad things.”*

## Tholonic Terminology Refresher

First (and for those who did not read the book), let’s review some of the fundamental concepts of the Tholonic model from “THOLONIA: The Mechanics of Existential Awareness”

### ***Yin Yang***

Most people have some concept of what *yin* and *yang* represent, but for clarification, we’ll reiterate: sometimes the words “positive” and “negative,” or the symbols “+” and “-,” are used to represent yang and yin. Here are some examples of yin and yang qualities that will help you get a feel for what they mean if you are not already familiar with them: **Yin**: dark, night, winter, moon, female, cold, water, alkaline, patience, to be, to rest, single-tasking, de-flamed, soothed, holistic, university of life, letting go, death, disease, emotion, not being, uncertainty, chaos, illogical, heart-based feelings. **Yang**: light, day, summer, sun, male, hot, fire, acid, impetuosity, action, multi-tasking, inflammation, burnout, allopathy, academia, control, life, health, to be, certainty, order, logic.

These concepts are relative. For example, “to be” exists in both categories, as “being” can be yin and/or yang. Water is yang to earth, but yin to fire. Like everything, the perception of things and properties is relative to the context and scope of its existence and application.

### ***Holon/Parton***

<img src='../Images/0_001.png' style='float:right;width:30%'/>In the Tholonic model, a holon is something that exists as both a whole and a part within a larger system. It maintains its own identity while contributing to the system it belongs to. For example, a cell in the human body is a holon because it functions independently but also plays a role in the body’s overall health. A parton, on the other hand, is a component within a holon that helps define its structure and function. Using the same example, the cell’s nucleus, mitochondria, and membrane are partons that work together to maintain the cell’s existence. Together, holons and partons illustrate the model’s focus on interconnectedness, where everything is both a part of something larger and a whole in its own right.

Holons combine to form self-organizing networks of interactions and relationships called a *holarchy*. The concept of a holarchy was introduced by Hungarian author and philosopher Arthur Koestler in his 1967 book *The Ghost in the Machine* [^15] to describe such systems.

[^15]: **Koestler, Arthur.** *The Ghost in the Machine.* Hutchinson, 1967.

### ***NDC***

*NDC* stands for *Negotiation-Definition-Contribution*, also known as *balance-limitation-integration*. In the Tholonic model, this trinity of interactions form the foundation of all existence:

**Negotiation (Balance):** This represents the process of balancing or achieving equilibrium as different forces interact. Depending on context, it can act as a verb (the act of balancing or negotiating) or as a noun (the state of having achieved balance or becoming negotiated). In diagrams, this is represented as a *blue* dot, and can also act as an initiating point, also called an *N-state*.

**Definition (Limitation):** This refers to the restrictions or boundaries that shape any creation, whether material (available physical resources), energetic (available energy), or structural (contextual constraints like sustainability, time, or space). In diagrams, this is represented as a *green* dot.

**Contribution (Integration/Interaction):** This represents what the process returns to its environment or parent tholon. Contributions can take many forms, such as interactions, material resources, ideas, or any effect that influences the system it exists in and interacts with. In diagrams, this is represented as a *red* dot.

<img src='../Images/0_006.png' style='float:right;width:100%'/>

Within the Tholonic model, the *NDC* trinity describes the core dynamic that allows systems to emerge, sustain themselves, and interact with their surroundings. In diagrams, the emergent property that results from the interaction of NDC is typically represented as a *yellow* dot in two-dimensional maps, or a *white* dot in three-dimensional maps, depending on the context and can also act as an *n-child* or *n-state*.

### ***N-child or n-state***

An *N-child* or *n-state* (with a lowercase “n”) refers to a new system or entity that emerges from an N-state (with a lowercase “N”) as a result of the system’s NDC interactions. This new creation inherits the structure and properties of its parent N-state but develops its unique identity. The term *N-child* highlights the creation’s role as the outcome or effect of a stable N-state, while *n-state* emphasizes the perspective of the creation as a product within its system. Through the recursive nature of the *thologram*, these *n-states* can evolve into *N-states* when they mature into stable systems capable of generating their own *n-states*, continuing the cycle of creation.

### ***Tholon***

<img src='../Images/4forces-tetra_v3.png' style='float:right;width:40%'/>A tholon is a specific type of holon within the Tholonic model—a tetrahedral unit composed of a central concept, representing a Negotiated state, or N-state (blue dot), and two partons, representing Defining properties (red dot) and a Contributing properties (green dot), interacting to produce an emergent outcome (white dot). These four points form the tetrahedral structure of a tholon. Think of it as a building block of reality, like an atom (with protons and electrons) forming matter, or a team (with leader and members) shaping a project.

There is also the concept of a *virtual* tholon. This occurs when the multi-generational self-similar triangular grid collapses into a tetrahedral matrix, or thologram. All tetrahedrons on the odd-numbered generations are orthoscopic, or front-facing, while even-numbered generations collapse to the pseudoscopic, or rear-facing. We refer to the front-facing tholons as *real* and the back-facing tholons as *virtual* tholons or *reflection* tholons. This means that the child tholon is always the opposite of the parent; real tholons create virtual tholons, and virtual tholons create real tholons, resulting in a virtual space that is half real and a real space that is half virtual.

### ***Thologram***

In the Tholonic model, the *thologram* is a self-organizing, self-similar, recursive tetrahedral matrix that represents the structure of that serves as a universal framework that applies to all forms of creation, whether abstract—such as theories, beliefs, and ideas—or material—such as galaxies, organisms, and ecosystems. Through its recursive nature, the thologram illustrates how patterns of creation repeat and evolve across different scales and contexts, reflecting the interconnected and self-organizing nature of existence.

## A&I: The Source of Energy and Existence

To best understand the basic premise of the Tholonic model, let’s use a thought experiment.

Imagine a point—a zero-dimensional point within an infinite void of nothingness. It exists only as a concept, without form, dimensions, or measurable properties. Its existence depends entirely on the awareness of it. Without this awareness, the void remains unchanged.

A core principle of the Tholonic model is that everything created inherits the attributes and limitations of its creator, albeit subject to the influence of the environment. We find this same concept in many arenas, such as philosophy, metaphysics, and science. It suggests that every creation carries an imprint of its origin, shaped by the nature, constraints, and intention of its source. It’s the basic concept behind why plants create plants, not cats or sneakers. In this case, where we have a conceptual point in a void of nothingness, there is no environment, and our zero-dimensional point, being only a concept, doesn’t even exist outside of a concept. However, given that our zero-dimensional point is an instance of *awareness*, i.e., a concept, we can say that this point, being a creation of awareness, has the property of *awareness*. Not only that, it must also have the property of *intention*, given that the awareness that conceived it did so with the intent to conceive it. In the Tholonic model, awareness and intention always exist together, as one cannot exist without the other.

With a moment’s thought, the obvious consequence of creating a point with awareness and intention can only result in that point doing the only thing it can do, which is to create another point via its own awareness and intention.

To say a point has awareness and intention sounds odd if we just think of it as a zero-dimensional concept, but to say that a *concept* has awareness and intention, while still sounding unfamiliar, is a very reasonable conclusion to make. The reasoning is as follows:

To understand why a concept inherently possesses awareness and intention, we must examine its nature and origin. A concept does not exist independently; it is entirely contingent on being conceived. A triangle, for instance, is not a physical entity but a mental construct—recognizable only because awareness defines it. Similarly, a zero-dimensional point has no physical presence, yet it exists because it has been conceived, making its existence an act of awareness.

However, awareness alone does not create; intention is also required. A thought arises only when there is a cause—whether deliberate or subconscious—meaning that every concept is not just a product of awareness but also of an intent to conceive it. As creation imparts the nature of its creator, any concept that emerges from awareness and intention must contain a latent form of both. While a concept may not exhibit active self-awareness, it retains the properties of recognition and directed purpose, making it a potential carrier of awareness when placed within a system capable of reflection.

This leads to an inevitable progression: if a point exists as a concept with awareness and intention, then its only natural action is to create another point, just as it was created. This is not arbitrary but a fundamental principle—creation begets creation—illustrating the recursive nature of awareness embedding itself into its manifestations. This leads to an inescapable conclusion: creation begets creation. The act of bringing something into being does not stop with a single occurrence—it propagates, like an idea passed from mind to mind, like a seed that grows and spreads. The zero-dimensional point, being purely conceptual, does not sit in static isolation. It is an active expression of the same principles that brought it into existence. And so, from nothingness, through awareness and intention, the first act of creation unfolds into the next, and the next, and so on.

Thus, what at first seemed an odd assertion—that a concept has awareness and intention—is revealed to be an inevitable truth, and the first instance of this truth is a duality, exemplified so simply in the concept of yin and yang, or 0 and 1.

With this in mind, let’s consider the most obvious and important foundation of the I Ching: the polarity of yin and yang. Although this concept arose before the birth of Taoism, the Taoist symbol of Yin/Yang (called the *Taijitu*) has come to embody this concept. We have seen this pattern before, perhaps as an archetype of one of the most fundamental expressions of energy in our universe tracing back to the Big Bang[^16]:


<center><img src='../Images/ic_yinyang.png' style='width:50%'/></center>

[^16]: **Delabrouille, Jacques.** *PSM Project: Planck Sky Model.* Université Paris Cité. Available at: https://apc.u-paris.fr/~delabrou/PSM/psm.html

This Taoist *Taijitu* symbol represents the duality that emerged from the oneness or monism of our zero-dimensional point (*blue-dot* or *N-state*), creating itself.

The ancient *Tao Te Ching*[^14], written by Lao Tzu, the founder of Taoism, explains quite simply and clearly how this progression advances:

*The Tao gives birth to One.* *One gives birth to Two.* *Two gives birth to Three.* *Three gives birth to the ten thousand things.*

[^14]: **Lao Tzu (trans. D.C. Lau).** *Tao Te Ching.* Penguin Classics, 1963

The first duality that emerges from the “One” is created when the blue dot inevitably creates its own zero-dimensional point (which we refer to as the “green dot”), which it will do given that it has no properties or attributes other than awareness and intention, and no form of limitation.

In our unthinkable thought experiment, the existence of a zero-dimensional point in nothingness might be considered a duality—that of a conceptual point and nothingness—but the nothingness itself did not exist as a concept prior to the appearance of the point. Strictly speaking, a conceptual point in nothingness is just a conceptual point. There is no duality, just the monism of the concept. So, while we can say that somethingness and nothingness, referring to the primal dot and the void it exists within, are the first duality, the fact that there is a concept of nothing proves this is inaccurate because the concept of nothing is itself something.

The more accurate description would be the duality of “Is” and “Is Not,” referring to the blue and green dot, because the creation of the green dot is the first instance of that which “Is Not” the blue dot, and the blue dot is the first instance of that which “Is.”

It might be a bit pedantic to argue the difference between *somethingness/nothingness* vs. *Is/Is Not*, but that difference turns out to play a very critical role in the Tholonic model because the concept of nothingness is not at all a limiting concept. On the contrary, it represents absolute, the unlimited freedom with no limitation, while the concept of *Is Not* is essentially the archetype of limitation.

Still, this is not the duality represented by the Taijitu. We know this because the Taijitu clearly shows us that within each part of the duality is a duality in itself. This is represented by the yang dot in the yin side and the yin dot in the yang side. The Taijitu is a duality of dualities. In fact, it is two overlapping dualities: the yin in the yang in the Taijitu and the yang in the yin in the Taijitu.

The Taijitu is a holon, with two partons—one predominantly yin and one predominantly yang. The yin and the yang are themselves holons, each with two partons. Altogether, this creates a total of six holons, five of which are partons to the primary holon, the Taijitu. That is interesting and relevant to the six lines of the I Ching, just as are the six lines or vertices of a tetrahedron, which is a point we’ll look at further on.

What is significant here is that the I Ching’s Taijitu is the first *n-state* in the thologram, with the primary *N-state* being the “One” created by the Tao, the Awareness and Intention of creation. The only difference is that the Taijitu shows a dynamic of change, or negotiating (mixing), while the *n-state* represents a negotiated state (i.e., mixed red and green, yellow).


<center><img src='../Images/0_007.png' style='width:80%'/></center>

One might think that *Awareness* and *Intention* are the actual first duality, but this is not the case in a practical sense because if awareness and intention are inseparable, such that one cannot exist without the other, then they are not truly a duality but rather a singularity that can be understood from two perspectives. A duality implies a distinction where each part can exist independently in contrast to the other, but if awareness cannot exist without intention and intention cannot exist without awareness, then they are two aspects of the same unified phenomenon rather than opposing or separate forces.

This mirrors wave-particle duality in physics, where a single underlying reality manifests differently depending on perspective. Likewise, awareness and intention are not separate entities but two perspectives of the same fundamental process—the act of conscious creation. Awareness is the recognition of existence, while intention is the directed movement within that recognition; yet neither can exist in isolation.

Rather than a duality, they form a self-referential singularity, where one perspective reveals awareness as the receptive aspect of existence, and the other reveals intention as its active counterpart. Awareness and intention are fundamentally one, appearing distinct only when expressed through a dualistic framework—the structure that enables differentiation.

The singularity itself does not split into awareness and intention; instead, differentiation emerges within an existing duality, giving rise to these aspects as distinct expressions. In this sense, duality is not created by the singularity but serves as its medium of manifestation, while the singularity itself remains whole and undivided. This medium arises through the singularity’s self-instantiation when the zero-dimensional dot creates a second dot—the first act of differentiation.

It is not a coincidence that these concepts are conceptually identical to Taoist philosophy. The relationships between the Tholonic model and Taoism are so remarkable that it could easily appear that the Tholonic model was derived from Taoism, but this is certainly not the case. The entire point of the Tholonic model was to create a model that could describe what energy is, not simply how it is observed, because currently, science has absolutely no explanation for that. In the process of that journey, the Tholonic model slowly took form. Its similarity with Taoism and a number of other philosophies and belief systems is a testament to humanity’s undaunted attempt to understand the true nature of existence.

Let’s explore the NDC trinity concept, as it will play an extremely significant role further on.

## Negotiation, Definition, and Contribution: The Core Interactions of Existence

In the Tholonic framework, all forms of existence are shaped by three fundamental interactions: negotiation, definition, and contribution. These forces influence every action, relationship, interaction, and transformation, whether referring to conceptual points in a void or galaxies and atoms.

In the context of our material reality, we see this as: **Work → Force → Distance** (Physics of Work); **Pressure → Area → Force** (Fluid Mechanics); **Momentum → Mass → Velocity** (Conservation of Momentum); **Power → Voltage → Current** (Electrical Power Equation); **Wavelength → Frequency → Speed** (Wave Equation); **Charge → Electric Field → Force** (Electrostatics); **Temperature → Volume → Pressure** (Gas Laws); **Stress → Strain → Elasticity** (Material Science); **Density → Mass → Volume** (Density Formula); **Friction → Surface Roughness → Force** (Friction Model)

Some practical examples are:

**Newton’s Second Law of Motion**: In *F=ma*, Force maps to negotiation (balance) as the interaction that drives change, mass maps to limitation (definition) as the resistance or boundary that shapes the interaction, and acceleration maps to contribution (integration) as the resulting effect or output of the system.

**Theory of Special Relativity: ** In *E = mc²*, energy (*E*) maps to contribution (integration) as the resulting effect or emergent property, mass (*M*) maps to limitation (definition) as the fundamental constraint or structure, and the speed of light squared (*C²*) maps to negotiation (balance) as the transformational factor that governs the interaction between mass and energy.

**Ohm’s Law**: In *V=IR*, Volts (V) maps to negotiation (balance) as the driving potential that enables interaction, resistance (R) maps to limitation (definition) as the resistance that constrains the flow, and amps (I) maps to contribution (integration) as the resulting current that flows through the system.

**Atomic Theory**: Neutrons map to negotiation (balance) as they stabilize the atom without carrying charge, protons map to limitation (definition) as they define the atomic identity through positive charge and structure, and electrons map to contribution (integration) as they facilitate interactions, bonding, and energy exchange within and between atoms.

**Chaos, Order, Emergence** *(as understood in Chaos Theory,Complex Systems Theory, Entropy and Information Theory, Cybernetics, and Self-Organization and Emergence )*: Chaos maps to negotiation (balance) as the dynamic field of possibilities seeking equilibrium, order maps to limitation (definition) as the structured constraints that shape and stabilize interactions, and emergence maps to contribution (integration) as the resulting patterns, structures, or phenomena that arise from their interplay.

**Quantum Mechanics.** In quarks, color charge maps to negotiation (balance) as quarks must achieve a stable, color-neutral state, flavor maps to limitation (definition) as it determines the identity and role of each quark, and strong interaction (gluon exchange) maps to contribution (integration) as it binds quarks together to form stable particles.

In the context of humanity, we see this same model applied to processes:

# Section II: The I Ching Basics

## The Structure of Trigrams and Hexagrams

The I Ching, like the thologram, has the basic concept of a trigram as the stable building block of structure. In the I Ching, a trigram is simply three states of yin/yang together to form a stable concept. There are eight possible combinations when using yin and yang (shown below).

<img src='../Images/i-ching-8.png' style='float:right;width:20%'/>The I Ching also has a concept of a “lower” and an “upper” state. It describes the lower state as earth, matter, the subjective, the hidden, the inner, etc. depending on context, and the “upper” state as that of heaven, ideas, archetypes, the outer, exposed and the arena of creation, etc, also depending on context. Just as the yin and yang lines represent the two states of something, the upper and lower trigrams represent the two states of the stable concept created by those lines. Already we see the self-similar properties of dualities of trinities as shown in the thologram as well.

Pairing these eight upper trigrams with the eight lower trigrams results in a total of 64 hexagrams, shown below (even values are blue, odd values are red for easier viewing). The number under the hexagram is the binary value of the hexagram when considering yin as 0 and yang as 1. This was the original Fu Xi (~2700 BCE) arrangement before the current King Wen (~1154 BCE, Zhou Dynasty) order was introduced. Unless otherwise noted, we will be using only the binary value to identify a hexagram.

>>>


<center><img src='../Images/ic_64hex.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

While there are 64 hexagrams, it is more useful to think of two different sets of 32 pairs of hexagrams. The reason this is more useful is that we can consider these 32 pairs as 32 singularities that instantiate in two different forms depending on the context.

##### Note: For clarity, referring to hexagrams can take the following form of **2䷁*~0~* the *Receptive***, where **2** is the traditional or King Wen number of the hexagram, **䷁** is the hexagram itself, and the small-italic ***~0~*** being the binary value of the hexagrams when yang=1 and yin=0. The name, ***Receptive***, is the traditional name, which may differ from the Tholonic I Ching name. Unless noted, all the hexagram name in this document are the traditional names.

For example, take the most basic hexagrams: 2䷁*~0~* the *Receptive*, and 1䷀*~63~* the *Creative*. Between these two hexagrams, all other hexagrams exist, so together, as a pair, they represent one state that includes the broadest context that everything exists within. Another example is the pair of hexagrams 39䷦*~20~* *Obstruction*, which states, “*When faced with dangerous obstacles it is wise to retreat and prepare accordingly with those of like mind*,” and its opposite, 38䷥*~43~* *Diverging Perspectives* or *Opposition*, which states, “*When opposites meet they must proceed with care, for brusqueness will lead to calamity, but through understanding and cooperation we can change an opposition into a polarity. This is how all things come into being*.”

The *meta* concept here is one of opposites and how they can interact either through polarity as cooperation or conflict.

## Mapping Trigrams to the Tholonic Model

*Note: To avoid confusion, a tholonic triple, which is essentially a triangle, is called a “triad” to distinguish from the I Ching trigram.*

A tholonic triad is a bit different, but quite compatible with the I Ching trigram. Instead of three states that the I Ching defines as beginning, middle, end, or earth, man, heaven, the triad is made of a source and the two polar opposites that emerge from that source, something like a *synthesis* that holds within it its own *thesis* and *antithesis*. The three lines of a trigram and the three points of a triad correlate with NDC.

The thologram also has a concept of *upper* and *lower* in that the *upper* trigram of the I Ching, which comes *after* the *lower* trigram, equates nicely to the *child* triad of a tholon, which comes *after* the parent. In other words, the *lower* I Ching trigram is the *parent* triad of the thologram, and the *upper* I Ching trigram is the *child* triad of the tholon. We can now see that the final hexagram is perfectly equivalent to a tholon map.


<center><img src='../Images/tri-is-hex.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

It might seem counterintuitive that the *upper* or *outer* trigrams of the I Ching equate to the smaller embedded triads of the thologram, but in the tholon it is the smallest and most embedded tholons that represent the bleeding edge of reality where new creations are being born, dying, and morphing. The farther “up” the thologram, the more fundamental the changes. In the thologram, the parent triad is what forms the environment or context for a new negotiated (i.e., stable) instance to come into existence, so the parent triad is the incubator, so to speak, for the yet-to-be-manifest N-state and its own duality. The smaller, inner triad inside the parent is where the newly created N-state creates its own environment, which incubates yet another N-state, and so on. This is why the I Ching’s *lower* trigram equates to the tholon’s *parent* triad, and the *upper* trigram equates to the child tholon’s instantiated *inner* triad.

If the thologram recurses inward and not outward, does this mean that all creations exist *within* the initial triad? Yes. This means that the initial form that everything exists within is a tetrahedron, within which are an infinite number of embedded tetrahedrons across an infinite number of generations.

*Note: One interesting detail is when we use the outer triad on the parent level with the inner triad on the child level; all the numbers, as indicated on the image above, for each side equal 9, (1+6+2), (2+4+3), (3+5+1), but if we associated the lower trigram with the inner triad, and the upper trigram with the outer triad, all the numbers for each side equal 12, (4+3+5), (5+1+6), (6+2+4). 9 is a smaller number and is more efficiently expressed (3<sup>3</sup>) than 12, which means it is “simpler” or has “less resistance” than the larger and more complex 12 (2<sup>2</sup>×3). That does not mean other mappings are incorrect, just that this one is the most efficient and therefore more likely to occur.*

## The Six Stages (I Ching and thologram)

According to the I Ching, there are 6 stages of change that describe the life-cycle of a creation or instance. This is stated very clearly:

-   *“All movements are accomplished in **six stages**, and the seventh brings return.”*

*<sub>~Hexagram 24 “Return”</sub>*

-   *“The holy man, who understands the mysteries of creation inherent in end and beginning, becomes superior to the limitations of the transitory. For him, the meaning of time is that in it, the stages of growth can unfold in a clear sequence. He is mindful at every moment and uses the **six stages of growth** as if they were six dragons on which he mounts to heaven.”

*<sub>~Commentary on hexagram 1, the Creative (Wilhelm/Baynes edition).</sub>*

This shows a general idea of the six steps from an I Ching and tholonic perspective. We can see these same six stages in modern applications, one of the many examples being the popular *Transtheoretical Model*[^204] used for addressing issues of growth, recovery, behavior, production, etc. We will use these archetypal qualities as properties of the six lines, not simply because it’s a reasonable presumption, but because the original I Ching texts support these definitions, as will be shown.

[^204]: Prochaska, J. O., & Velicer, W. F. (1997). The Transtheoretical Model of Health Behavior Change. American Journal of Health Promotion, 12(1), 38–48. https://doi.org/10.4278/0890-1171-12.1.38

For this example, we will use the hexagram 63䷾*~21~* *After Completion*, which represents the perfect or ideal order of the hexagrams.


<center><img src='../Images/simple_lines-1.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

Here is another way to look at the tholonic/I Ching relationship:


<center><img src='../Images/line-tao.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

One way to understand the 6 stages is by looking at the 6 steps of bifurcation needed to create 64 children from one source. Notice how the 1<sup>st</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> level of bifurcation (blue shaded line) are the tholonic *Negotiation* line, which is the only area where new *N-states* can form to create potential tholons. These lines are the lines of the archetypes of *Inception* and *Emergence*, representing the starting line of each of the two trigrams.

Another way of looking at the 6 stages is by comparison. In the image below, I have tried to select the best concepts to map together solely based on what “made sense” to me. I am sure there is a better, more verifiable metric to base these on, so these are shown as examples, not as claims.

In the “Tholon” diagram below, the numbers in the center triangle are in their tholonic order, and in the other two diagrams, they are in the I Ching order.


<center><img src='../Images/colorfog-tri2.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

Look at the numbered triangle in the “Plant Example” above. Note the qualities of the points that form the corners (which are yang in nature), such as 1, 3, and 5 (GERMINATE, BLOOM, SEED) that form the connecting lines (which are yin in nature) 2, 4, and 6 (growth, fruiting, recycle). Look at the quality of the pairs that are composed of a point and its opposite line. For example, there are three such pairs: GERMINATE/fruiting, BLOOM/recycle, and SEED/growth. We can understand these pairs as the conceptual polarities of the 3 parent concepts:

-   **The Beginning** (germination, reproduction) 
-   **The Limits** (blooming and death) 
-   **The Work**: What “it must do” as an existence (it must sustain its existence).

There is yet another way to look at the structure of the lines, and one that is arguably the basis of the current King Wen interpretation of the I Ching.


<center><img src='../Images/dot-cicrle-ary.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

***Fig. k1*** shows a simple binary tree that starts at the center and bifurcates outward to 64 end-points. This form is especially useful because it so clearly shows the direction of the YIN movement (***Fig. k2a***) and the YANG movement (***Fig. k2b***), and when we add these two opposite moving patterns together we can see an impressive self-similar fractal pattern (***Fig. k3***). ***Fig. k4*** shows the dots and the lines together, but in addition, each of the six concentric bands has been colorized according to their NDC correlation, and the connective lines have been greatly thickened, with a Taijitu symbol added to the middle to represent the original duality.


<center><img src='../Images/dot-circle-anatomy.png' style='width:80%'/></center>

Each of these concentric rings represents each successive bifurcation, which defines each of the lines in a hexagram. The above image shows the path from the beginning to the end for hexagram 5䷄*~23~* *Waiting/Nourishment*.

Here are all 64 hexagrams represented in this star-chart where the innermost value is the octal (base-8) value in mono-spaced text. The next ring of values is the binary value in decimal, then the King Wen name of the hexagram, and then the King Wen number of the hexagram.

<center><img src='../Images/dot-circle-64.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

This structure tells us a lot about the I Ching. For example, this sequence is the most naturally occurring pattern, and by natural, we mean the most organically formed and the most obvious in nature itself. In this <img src='../Images/64-plot.png' style='float:right;width:30%'/> pattern we can clearly see the fractal and self-similar nature of the pattern that is made obvious by the procession of the octal values, which follows a pattern shown on the right of two identical sets that are offset by the X value of 1.  **WHY?**~~We can also see that the significance of the two sets of numbers {0,4,2,6} and {1,5,3,7}, the values and sequence of which turn out to be extraordinarily revealing later on~~. We can also see the four major cardinal points (North, East, West, South) hold a unique value that clearly identifies that as cardinal in nature, as do the clear but different values that identify the minor cardinal points (NE, NW, SE, SW). Notice every hexagram has its perfect opposite value (i.s., both values sum to 63) on the horizontally opposite side.

To see this last example better, we highlighted the paths of each of the cardinal and semi-cardinal paths and show the hexagrams they produce along with their traditional name and meaning as per Wilhelm/Baynes[^13], with their traditional King Wen sequence number in parentheses.

[^13]: **Wilhelm, Richard, and Cary F. Baynes, trans.** *The I Ching or Book of Changes.* Princeton University Press, 1967

On the right, we show the overarching theme of the two hexagrams that join at the cardinal points.


<center><img src='../Images/dot-circle-3a-2.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

In addition, each perfect pair (a hexagram and its inverse form together) has its own *theme* or *context* that exists with these cardinal themes. In other words, in the context of the cardinal themes, it is the two adjacent hexagrams that define it, even though the hexagrams may not be a perfect pair, while the 32 perfect pairs are made of only perfectly inverse or opposite hexagrams. One interesting observation, of the 8 cardinal pair themes and the 32 pair themes, the only pairs that are the same in both contexts are 2䷁*~0~* ***Receptive*** ⇔ 1䷀*~63~* **CREATIVE** and 24䷗*~1~* ***Return*** ⇔ 44䷫*~62~* **COMING TO MEET**, which are the first of the 32 pairs and which define the limits of the entire I Ching, suggesting that this pair defines an even broader parent theme of “Movement within duality.”

##### Before we continue, we need to briefly look at this fundamental concept or pairs in the I Ching, specifically, the concepts of *ascending* and *descending* hexagrams.

***Ascending*** hexagrams have a yin line in the 6<sup>th</sup> place and have a binary value less that 32, and are shown in italics-bold for easy identification as ascending.

**DESCENDING** hexagrams have a yang line in the 6<sup>th</sup> place and a binary value greater than 31, and are shown in all caps-bold.

These classifications come from the observation that ascending hexagrams represent the movement from pure yin, 2䷁*~0~* ***Receptive***, to the maximum yang that can be supported before it can no longer be classified as ascending, or 43䷪*~31~* ***Breakthrough***. Likewise, descending hexagrams represent a pure yang state 1䷀*~63~* **CREATIVE**, to the minimum yin state that can be supported, 23䷖*~32~* **DISSOLUTION**.

The ascending accumulates yang and the descending disseminates yang. This is a concept that the King Wen authors must have also seen as it is evident in their interpretations that show:

- ***Ascending*** hexagrams represent processes that culminate in openness to transformation, alignment with larger forces, and acceptance of natural cycles. They emphasize receptivity, adaptation, and harmony with circumstances beyond personal control.

- **DESCENDING** hexagrams represent processes that culminate in assertion, definition, and extension of influence, and emphasize initiative, structure, and the application of will to shape circumstances.

For example, 46䷭*~6~* ***Pushing Upward*** represents the accumulation of yang through gradual, persistent effort of growth that succeeds through receptivity to natural cycles, like a plant pushing upward through soil, while its paired opposite, 25䷘*~57~* **INNOCENCE**, represents the dissemination of yang, spontaneous, natural action aligned with cosmic order, where one's inner integrity manifests as outer success through the power of acting without calculated intent.

Tholonically speaking, the ascending hexagrams embody the principle of Limitation/Definition as they represent the contextual boundaries and natural cycles that define our scope of possibility and the larger forces beyond personal control that we must recognize and adapt to. Conversely, the descending hexagrams embody the principle of Contribution/Integration as they represent how we actively contribute to our reality through assertion, initiative, and the application of will to shape circumstances. This relationship creates a dynamic spectrum: ascending hexagrams establish the contextual limitations within which we operate, while descending hexagrams demonstrate how we integrate with and contribute to that context. Just as Limitation and Contribution define the spectrum across which all negotiated states come into existence in the Tholonic model, these two complementary classes of hexagrams define the entire spectrum of possibilities that all 64 hexagrams represent, each showing a unique relationship between accepting the limitations of our context and actively contributing to it.

For reference, here is the list of all 32 pairs that represent the ascending and descending aspects of the parent concept, or “Path Name.” *Note: these tholonic names and pair names are a first draft.*

<center><img src='../Im	ages/32pairs.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

See the appendix for a more thorough analysis of the relationship between the polar and binary order.

##### With this in mind, let’s continue where we left off.

The first thing we notice in the circular star-charts above is that the exact opposites of 2䷁*~0~* ***Receptive*** and 1䷀*~63~* **CREATIVE** begin and end the cycle at the top. Their opposite pair, at the bottom, is made up of the opposite hexagrams of 24䷗*~1~* the ***Return*** and 44䷫*~62~* **COMING TO MEET**. Considering this is exactly the point where the cycle begins to return, it suggests that the King Wen interpreters of the I Ching saw this same pattern.

We can also see that each pair of hexagrams for the same point has a meaning that is similar from two different aspects. On the above-right image, we have renamed these points according to the theme they share, or what we also refer to as the *path name*. Further on, we look at how this was arrived at.

The other thing we notice is the symmetry of the numbers, wherein every pair of opposite (ascending/descending) values on opposite sides of the vertical axis always equals 63, for example 25䷘*~57~* **INNOCENCE** and 46䷭*~6~* ***Pushing Upwards*** where 57 + 6 = 63. The same is true for every lower and upper trigram and their opposite equaling 7, but in the case of the ascending trigrams, the axis is diagonal from the lowest right sector to the highest left sector, and for the descending trigrams, the axis is mirrored, from lowest left to the highest right sector.

<img src='../Images/dot-circle-3a-2_axis.png' style='float:right;width:40%'/>These axes are not easily visualized, so here is a diagram, and, as we can see, the lower trigram connections follow crossed, diverging paths suggesting dynamism or tension, while the upper trigram connections form a more ordered, symmetrical geometric pattern suggesting stability and structure. This visual difference could represent the contrasting nature or functions of the upper and lower trigrams in I Ching philosophy, with lower trigrams potentially representing more dynamic, changing inner conditions and upper trigrams representing more structured, manifest outer conditions.  This is consistant with the concept that the lower trigrams is the more formative “inner” and the upper trigram is the more manifest “outer.”

Here is an overview of the cardinal pairs shown above, using the traditional King Wen hexagram titles and meanings

-   Pair 1)  1䷀*~63~* **CREATIVE** ⇔ 2䷁*~0~* ***Receptive***
-   - Both of these hexagrams define an extreme end point, the polarity that defines the spectrum within which every other hexagrams exists. This defines **arena of creation**.
- 
-   Pair 2) 10䷉*~59~* **TREADING** ⇔ 15䷎*~4~* **Modesty***
-   - Both of these describe a time when the high and the low are in **harmony**. In one case (*Peace*), it is the result of the times, and in the other (TREADING), it is the result of decorum and when pleasant manners succeed.
- 
-   Pair 3) 13䷌*~61~* **FELLOWSHIP** ⇔ 7䷆*~2~* ***T he Army***
-   - Both hexagrams speak of **progress**. In one case (*Approach*), it is the result of the time, such as spring time. The other case (FELLOWSHIP) speaks of progress in difficult times as long as people unify and are working towards the goals of humanity.
- 
-   Pair 4)  25䷘*~57~* **INNOCENCE** ⇔ 46䷭*~6~* ***Pushing Upward***
-   - Both hexagrams refer to finding the inner light for **guidance**. In one case (*Darkening*), when external circumstances are unfavorable, and in the other (INNOCENCE), when one is at risk of wandering off the path of righteousness.
- 
-   Pair 5) 44䷫*~62~* **COMING TO MEET** ⇔ 24䷗*~1~* ***Return***.
-   - Both hexagrams speak of a **reversing course**. In one case (*Return*), it is the natural turn of the cycle when the light returns to the darkness. In the other (COMING TO MEET), it is the result of a decision but warns one of allowing the inferior to gain access to the superior. However, it also admits that this meeting of “inferior” and “superior” is what brings about all life.
-   
-   Pair 6) 6䷅*~58~* **CONFLICT** ⇔ 36䷣*~5~*  ***Darkening of the Light***
-   - Both hexagrams speak of the need for **adaptation** if progress is to succeed. In the one case (*Pushing Upward*), because of one’s modesty and adaptability. In the other, (CONFLICT) there is a warning to avoid treachery and only consider modest and amicable means of progressing when met with resistance.
- 
-   Pair 7) 33䷠*~60~* **RETREAT** ⇔ 19䷒*~3~* ***Approach*** 
-   - Both hexagrams speak of the management of **force**. In one case (*Army*), it speaks of discipline, as well as trust in a leader, that is necessary for a force to be effective. In the other (RETREAT), the wise use of force is needed when facing a stronger force.
- 
-   Pair 8) 12䷋*~56~* **STANDSTILL** ⇔ 11䷊*~7~* ***Peace*****. 
-   - Both hexagrams describe a time when the end of a cycle has arrived, and as it is returning to the point it started, the final ***destination***. In one case (*Modesty*), it tells of how the law of nature is to raise that which is low, and lower that which is high. In the other case (STANDSTILL), the end has arrived as confusion and disorder because the dark waxing power has given rise to lowly people. In such times, faith in one’s principles is the only recourse.

These cardinal pairs can be reduced again to a more abstracted four pairs, and they can be reduced further to two, which would be the duality from which everything emerges. I argue here that this duality is the same duality that everything evolved from as well, that of *Definition* and *Contribution*, and everything exists as a result of *Negotiation* between those two states.

For those who are familiar with machine learning or artificial intelligence, you’ll notice that this bifurcating concept map (above) is quite similar to a classic neural network architecture (above, lower right); the difference being a neural net connects every parent to all children, while our map’s parents connect only to its two children. The other big difference between a neural net and this concept map is that a neural net is designed to discover and learn, while this concept map is exposing the pattern that already exists.

## Understanding the Six Lines

There are not 6 lines in order to make 64 hexagrams; there are 64 hexagrams because there are 6 lines. The creators of the I Ching deliberately chose to use 6 lines because they knew that 6 is the minimum needed to create a complete archetype. This is an idea that we see not only across many cultures all over the world, specifically in their stories of creation, but in science and geometry:

> -   The simplest form of creation, the tetrahedron (and tholonic structure) is composed of 6 vectors.
>
> -   
>
> -   The Abrahamic traditions (i.e., Torah, Old Testament, Quran) say all of creation was accomplished in 6 days.
>
> -   
>
> -   The Babylonian creation myth, the Enuma Elis, where the one God created 6 gods, each in charge of the 6 different aspects of creation (where they spent 2 days creating everything and the rest of their days fighting with each other).
>
> -   
>
> -   The original Greek Titans were 6 men (Oceanus, Coeus, Crius, Hyperion, Iapetus, and Cronus), and their sisters, the Titanides (Theia, Rhea, Themis, Mnemosyne, Phoebe, and Tethys). They were all the children of the original 2 primordial gods, Uranus (primordial sky) and Gaia (primordial earth).
>
> -   
>
> -   In the building blocks of creation (chemistry) we see 6 electrons in carbon, the foundation of life.
>
> -   
>
> -   And, as we we’ll show shortly, The N-source has a value of 6.<img src='../Images/planisphere-nineveh-2.png' style='float:right;width:20%'/>

6 seems to be a very significant number and is firmly associated with the concept of creation. The utility of the number 6 is probably why the Sumerians invented a base-6 system, which we still use today (360°, 24 hours, 12 months), which they used to plot the stars with surprising accuracy, as we know from the *Planisphere of Nineveh* (right), and calculated values in the trillions (of what, we don’t know).

Below is a chart that shows a more in-depth description of the 6 steps from a tholonic and I Ching perspective. It is divided into two hexagrams, *lower* and *upper*. Pay attention to the similarity of the three concepts that each line in the trigram shares with each other, as they are essentially mirror aspects of one another.

##### Note: It is both difficult and misleading to use one word to define an archetype that can have many different instances, nevertheless, we do exactly that, but remind the reader that these words are simply hints to a much larger significance.


<center><img src='../Images/line-desc-1.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

Once we cross the line from *lower* to the *upper*, the quality of the line positions flip, making what was **yang** in the *lower* trigram **yin** in the *upper* trigram, and vice versa. In the tholon, we see this same reversal in the children tholons, *reflection* triads, and *virtual* tholons.


<center><img src='../Images/line-desc-2.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

Here we equate the *upper* and *lower* trigrams of the I Ching to the three tholonic attributes of N, D, and C.


<center><img src='../Images/tho-table.png' style='width:80%'/></center>

Depending on the context (*upper* or *lower*), N, D, and C have slightly different expressions. In the most general sense, N, D, and C can represent many different concepts depending on their context.


<center><img src='../Images/tho-table-2.png' style='width:80%'/></center>

Because the I Ching is about the nature of unending change, it might serve us to view the stages of change as a continuous stream of change in the form of a wave, which we attempt to do in the image below


<center><img src='../Images/6stage-side-front.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

This continuity is consistent with the I Ching when it states: “*All movements are accomplished in six stages, and the seventh brings return.*” Here we see how the seventh stage returns us to the first stage of the next cycle. Another validation of using this waveform as a model is that the lower trigram of lines 1, 2, and 3 is, in fact, in the lower part of the waveform, and the upper trigram of 4, 5, and 6 is in the upper part.

On the right is a front view of the waveform that shows how the cycle is composed of six stages that alternate between yin (orange) and yang (blue). Within one complete cycle, we have highlighted the significant axis and their yin and yang properties. Using the archetypal yin/yang values for the six lines, we see that the upper half, being outward in nature, and the left half, being ascending in nature, are both yang. The lower half, being inner in nature, and the right half, being descending in nature, are both yin. This results in four quadrants that are, respectively, yin-yin (`00`<img src='../Images/bc/bigram00.png' style='width:35px'/> or 0), yin-yang (`10`<img src='../Images/bc/bigram01.png' style='width:35px'/> or 2), yang-yang (`11`<img src='../Images/bc/bigram11.png' style='width:35px'/> or 3), and yang-yin (`01`<img src='../Images/bc/bigram01.png' style='width:35px'/> or 1), which are shown in each corner as bigrams.

It might seem odd that the cycle starts at the 4:00 position on the circular chart, and not the 6:00 position, but the positions of the lines were determined by their yin/yang qualities. The vertical axis is the only axis that aligns with the 6 axes of the lines, and as line 2 is a yin line within a yin hemisphere, it naturally represents the nadir. The same is true for its opposite, line 5.

Interesting side note: in Christian monasticism, traditional Chinese medicine, some military and agricultural traditions, and even human hormonal cycles, 4:00 AM is considered the start of a new day. This correlates with the Medieval folklore and Christian traditions that “devil’s hour” is 3:00 AM.


<center><img src='../Images/dot-circle-plant.png' style='width:20%'/></center>

## The Form of Hexagrams

We can easily recognize this same archetypal structure of the I Ching and the tholon in many systems, from the process of mitosis to the shape of trees and plants with their *inner* roots and *outer* branches and leaves. This is significant because in the thologram there is a similar concept of a real tholon and a virtual tholon which are matched to create a complete tholon. We also saw an example of this in the book “THOLONIA - The Mechanics of Existentian Awareness” when looking at how the complete tholon models quarks to the proton.

In the thologram, all odd-numbered tholons are *real* and all even-numbered tholons are *virtual*. Likewise, all hexagrams that begin with a yin line are even-numbered hexagrams, and those that begin with a yang line are odd-numbered. We now have a very clean mapping between the thologram and the I Ching of *virtual* as yin and *real* as yang.

We arrived at the same results of 6 fundamental concepts formed by a pair of triads from two completely different processes: the process of the thologram was based on creating a tetrahedron from a point, while the I Ching is based solely on the binary system.

There are many mappings and similarities between the tholon and the I Ching, but I will only show one more because it not only maps hexagrams to tholons but to basic physical structures in nature

If we create a binary tree of the I Ching where the bifurcations follow the path of least resistance, meaning they will always move into the emptiest space, we end up with bifurcations separated by 60° (which is also the angle that creates a tetrahedron/tholon). This would then create the following patterns for each of the 6 generations of bifurcations.


<center><img src='../Images/overlay-gen.png' style='width:90%'/></center>

Simply splitting one line into two lines, in accordance with the laws of entropy, we naturally form a pattern of hexagons that perfectly matches the pattern of tholonic expansion. This is because the I Ching and the thologram represent the same laws but in the context of a binary system (I Ching) and a trinary, or synergetic, system (thologram). Not surprisingly, the one point they both naturally center around is the N-source, which we have already shown to be equivalent to the Taijitu ☯.

The image below is a more in-depth version of the overlay above. In that image, we follow each bifurcation starting with the one point from which the original duality emerged. The arrows show the direction of the movement, with left-sided (or *port* side, as the side is relative to the direction of the arrow) arrows as yin and right-sided (or *starboard* side) arrows as yang (or vice versa). Doubled-headed arrows indicate that one line (in the same direction) is shared by two parents, and lines with arrows in both directions indicate a shared line that is bidirectional.


<center><img src='../Images/hex_builder.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

***Fig. hb1*** shows the paths of all 64 hexagrams of the I Ching which are the result of 6 generations. ***Fig hb2*** shows the 7th generation. This is added only to show that with the 7th generations we get the first complete closure of a hexagram (the first one, in the center), which is another example of the “*All movements are accomplished in six stages, and the **seventh** brings return*”. ***Fig hb3*** is the same pattern, but iterated over 13 generations, generating 8,192 (or 2<sup>13</sup>) final values. It is included simply to show how the larger form remains a hexagram and how only the last two generations (purple and cyan) are even visible, occluding all previous generations. Notice how at this point, the dominant pattern, which will remain the dominant pattern for all future children, are two sets of three double-headed arrows, one set from the final generation (right), and one from the previous generation (left), shown in this image<img src='../Images/triplet-pairs.png' style='width:30px'/>.This pattern of 2×3 (final generations × intersections of movement) does not appear until the 2<sup>3</sup> (or 8<sup>th</sup>) generation. Because new generations overlap the previous when shown in two dimensions, we can’t see that this is really more of a 3D design, with the originating point in the center, expanding with each generation, creating a hexagonal cone.

Also of interest in this diagram is how it shows that the original N-source is the result of its own creation *after* 6 generations. In other words, after 6 generations, a new N-source is created that begins a new cycle and *departs* from the previous. Notice that it is the 5<sup>th</sup> place where two different cycles come together for the first time, which is why the 5<sup>th</sup> place is one of *integration*.

All of this is to demonstrate how the two systems are quite compatible to the point where not only can the entire I Ching be mapped to the thologram, but the thologram can greatly elaborate on the I Ching and give it a 3D structure, and given its recursive nature, infinitely so.

# Section III: Tholonic-I Ching Mapping

## Directional Flow of the I Ching

The I Ching, according to the Tholonic model, has two “directions”: ascending and descending. The ascending direction consists of the first 32 binary values, while the descending direction consists of the following 32 binary values.

In the Tholonic model, the natural order of change follows this progression: Low-entropy chaos → order and complexity → high-entropy chaos.

A good example of this pattern is the progression of the universe from the Big Bang to its ultimate fate. The universe begins in a state of low-entropy chaos (the Big Bang), expands and develops increasing order and complexity, and eventually declines into high-entropy chaos, such as Heat Death, the Big Freeze, the Big Rip, Vacuum Decay, the Black Hole Era, and Hawking Radiation Evaporation, as all structure dissipates.

The ascending side of the I Ching is where we move from the ultimate yin state, 2䷁*~0~* *Receptive*, to the maximum yang state that can exist in the yin domain, 43䷪*~31~* *Breakthrough*. The descending side begins as 23䷖*~32~* *Splitting Apart*, the maximum yin state that can exist in the yang domain, and continues to the ultimate yang state of 1䷀*~63~* *The Creative*.

This model indicates that ䷁ and ䷀ are the two states of maximum chaos, the yin chaos of maximum entropy and the yang chaos of minimum entropy. It may seem odd to associate yin with low entropy and yang with high entropy, but the reasoning is as follows:

Receptivity (䷁) is the most compatible with low entropy because it represents a state of maximum potential, where energy remains unstructured and available for directed transformation. Like a vacuum that can accommodate limitless expansion, an all-Yin system has no imposed direction or movement, meaning it holds the greatest capacity for ordered, purposeful development. Since low entropy corresponds to a system where energy is highly concentrated and has not yet been dispersed, receptivity aligns perfectly with this principle, as it provides the ideal environment for structured emergence without yet engaging in full expression.

Creation (䷀) is the most compatible with high entropy because it represents the full expression and expansion of energy into its maximum form. With all lines being Yang, there is no room left for additional directed movement, meaning the system has reached its most fully realized, high-entropy state. In this sense, creation aligns with high entropy because energy has been fully utilized and distributed, leaving no latent potential for further directed transformation. Like a star that has burned through its fuel, creation signifies a state where all available energy has been expressed, requiring a return to receptivity for renewal.

This diagram shows the order of pairs and the entire sequence (the 10 red pairs of hexagrams have a balance of three yin and three yang)


<center><img src='../Images/0_008.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

This seems to suggest that the ultimate end of the Universe is represented by 1䷀*~63~* *The Creative*, which seems contrary to reason, but here is the reasoning that supports this idea.

The 1䷀*~63~* *The Creative* is the universe at its most complete, the culmination of all possible expression. It is the final state in which energy has been fully structured, fully realized, and fully spent. Nothing more can be created because everything that could exist has already emerged. All differentiation, all movement, all transformation has reached its peak, leaving no further possibilities for change. In this moment, the universe is absolute, total, and without remainder, a condition so complete that nothing new can enter, nothing old can be undone. It is a moment of pure finality, where all that has been set into motion has played out its course, and what remains is a universe that has nothing left to become.

Yet this ultimate expression is, paradoxically, the threshold of a new beginning. When all has been fully realized, there is no longer movement, and when movement ceases, the conditions for a new cycle arise. The Creative, in exhausting itself, returns to 2䷁*~0~* *Receptive*, not as a separate phase, but as the inevitable consequence of total expression. Just as the highest note of a song fades into silence, or a fire that has consumed all its fuel leaves behind the empty space where new growth can occur, the universe at its most complete is indistinguishable from the universe before it was born. The final expression is not merely an end; it is a return to the pure potential from which everything emerges.

Thus, the greatest fullness and the greatest emptiness are the same. The ultimate creation and the formless void are not opposites, but two ways of perceiving a singular reality. One is the last moment before dissolution, the other is the first moment before formation—but thermodynamically, they are identical. What we call an ending is nothing but the stillness before a new beginning, and what we call a beginning is only the next emergence of movement from that stillness. The Creative, having fully expressed itself, does not collapse into nothingness—it *becomes nothingness*, and in doing so, it prepares for creation once more.

Lao Tzu not only alludes to this duality of oneness when describing the nature of the Tao, but is quite clear that the end of one begets the other, alternating in sequence, each being the cause and the effect of the other.

> ##### As soon as beauty is known by the world as beautiful, it becomes ugly. *As soon as virtue is being known as something good, it becomes evil.* *Therefore being and non-being give birth to each other.* *Difficult and easy accomplish each other.* *Long and short form each other.* *High and low distinguish each other.* *Sound and tone harmonize each other.* *Before and after follow each other as a sequence.* \~ Lao Tzu,Tao Te Ching

We can see a similar pattern in the evolution of the lines if we apply the six stages of growth to the previous model of all the lines in all 64 hexagrams.

## Just a Touch of Chaos

The following is a bit of a tangent, but worth sharing before we continue with the lines. Below is a graphic that shows three conditions of the descending pattern of chaos→order. The first condition is *Maximum Freedom*, where the direction of the children is undetermined and completely unlimited. The second condition, *Limited Freedom*, is where the direction of the children is limited by 96% (4% freedom). The final condition, *No Freedom*, is where there can be no deviation from the rule. This is an excellent example of the effect of and necessity for definition and limitation.


<center><img src='../Images/3stage-freedom.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

The forms used to represent the stages of change are “perfect” archetypes, in that they adhere strictly to a very tight set of rules. In reality, there are many other forces in play other than an isolated set of rules, making it rare, if not impossible, for a perfect archetype to instantiate. These other forces introduce variations. In the image above, with just a little bit of chaos, we get forms that are much closer to what we see in the real world. In the images below, we added a little more variation to our perfect process on just two variables, length and angle, resulting in a wider variety of “realistic” forms. The black forms below each variation show the perfect archetype they were based on.

## By the Numbers

Let’s run another test to see if the thologram and the I Ching are two views of the same model.

Previously we assigned the positions of the points on the tholon as 1 through 6 in order to work with the positions of the I Ching lines, but while the I Ching order (sequential from top including lines) was 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, the tholonic order was 0, 5, 1, 3, 2, 4. Here is where the validity of that order is shown.

Now we need to work with the hexagrams and their values, so we need to use the position of the points as the exponential value of 2 (because we’re working in binary), and to do that we need to start counting at 0, not 1. In ***Fig. e1*** (below) you can see the values arrived at for each point, and the exponent used to get that value. ***Fig. e2*** shows the sum of these values for each triad and each side. In ***Fig. e3*** we have added the name and the hexagram. Don’t forget that all these numbers are binary and not the numbers as they appear in the traditional I Ching layout.


<center><img src='../Images/tritest.png' style='width:80%'/></center>

##### Note: We identify the lines by grouping together the two points that form that line. This is usually shown with the traditional **overline** symbol, however, due to the limitation of the text formatting tools, in written text this will be shown as underlined, for example <u>ND</u> refers to the connecting line between N and D)*.


<center><img src='../Images/trialgebra.png' style='width:30%'/></center>

Here are some other observations:

-   The sum of any triad and the side opposite that triad always equal 63, the maximum number possible. This was exciting to discover as it supports the tholonic claim that the effect of any point can be seen on the side opposite that point. In our example above, we see the side 41䷨*~35~* *Decrease* plus the opposing corner of 31䷞*~28~* *Wooing* equals 35 + 28 = 63
-   
-   Every number our example (14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56), including their sums (63, 70), is a product of the *white dot*, which has a value of 7 multiplied 2 to 10.
-   
-   Every value of a triad plus its opposite border equals 9 (6+3, 7+2, 5+4, 8+1). This lends more support to the tholonic idea that a corner point (or in this case, corner triad) is paired with it’s opposite border.
-   
-   Every hexagram derived from the tholonic values has an equal number of yin and yang lines (only 10 of the 32 pairs of hexagrams in the I Ching have an equal number of yin and yang)
-   
-   Only the numbers of the top triad, which is the originating triad, are odd.

There are many more patterns and relationships as well, and this is only within one tholon that has no parents or children!

## Better Proof

Given that every number has a patterned relationship with one or more numbers, we can reverse engineer where every I Ching hexagram sits in the thologram, meaning we can assign a unique binary value to every vector (or point, but we are only showing vectors here). Remember the chapter that hypothesized how, if each tholon had a unique binary value, then we could unfold the history of that tholon from the moment of creation to the present? The I Ching is an example of just that, with a very small set of unique binary numbers.

There is some significant evidence that the I Ching and the thologram are based on the same model. Given that the Kabbalah and the I Ching are also based on the same model (which I will not elaborate on here as it is way too long), we can speculate that there is an underlying model that many perspectives of understanding are based on. I do not doubt that the thologram could be used as a tool for divination, mysticism, magic, alchemy, etc. as much as it could for chemistry, physics, electronics, and many other applications. Any truth that exists can be found in many different instances, and its truth is just as valid in one context as in another. The only limitation is the creative imagination of the perceiver.

However, if you still have doubts, what follows is a demonstration of how the value of *pi* (π) can be derived using the Tholonic model along with the values shown here derived from the I Ching. We can also find *pi* in the thologram alone, as previously described, by using the total number of N-sources for all the real and virtual tholons for each generation. While this technique uses the same method, it is using very different data.

<img src='../Images/times7.png' style='width:80%'/>

***Fig. h1*** shows the hexagram values as multiples of 7. ***Fig h2*** shows the same values, but shows how the same border values of 2, 3 and 5 apply to all the triads. Let’s apply the Tholonic model to these numbers. We arrived at these numbers by taking the sums of the binary values for each side, as shown above, which gave us 14, 21 and 35, As these numbers are all multiples of 7, we use the multiplier values.

Notice how the edges that are universal to all triads are the first three prime numbers, 2, 3, 5, and the multiplier is the 4<sup>th</sup> prime and top triad, 7. We’ll assign these values to the lower case version of their opposite point: *n=2, d=3, c=5*. This also means that *<u>ND</u>*=5, *<u>DC</u>*=2, *<u>CN</u>*=3.

The Tholonic model states that the *green dot* (*Definition*) is what creates limits and restricts the N-state, so D reduces N. The *red dot* (*Contribution*), seeing as it contributes, will be added to N.

We start by assigning N=1. As D and C are part of, or children of N, we then calculate D as $\frac{1}{c}$ and C as $\frac{1}{d}$. To create a new instance of N we start with the original N, subtract D, and add C. So, N<sub>1</sub>=N<sub>0</sub> - $\frac{1}{d}+\frac{1}{c}$, or N<sub>1</sub>=1 - $\frac{1}{5}+\frac{1}{2}$= 0.78539822525372. We repeat this process again, but we increment d and *c* by *n<sup>2</sup>*. After doing this a million or so times, we get the number 0.7853982294712. Multiply this number by *n<sup>2</sup>* (which is 4) and you get π.

This graph below diagrams the process (and shows the results already multiplied by 4). Notice how this is exactly the same model that was proposed for transforming a holon from the holarchic model to a tholon. Included are the formulas that show how to do the calculations with nothing but the existing I Ching values and using the mathematical relationships of the tholon (see Appendix C or the book)


<center><img src='../Images/pi-holons2.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

One interesting observation is that the first triad of NCD uses a simple formula, and all the rest use that same formula, but modified by *n*, which didn’t exist in the first triad. This is an excellent example of the “*The Tao gives birth to One. One gives birth to Two. Two gives birth to Three. Three gives birth to the ten thousand things.*”

For anyone that wants to replicate/test this process, the program is at the end of this book.

We can also calculate the value for Phi (φ, 1.618) and the Fibonacci sequence using a similar process, and if we replace the values of 1, 2, 3, 5 with the values of 2<sup>0</sup>, 2<sup>1</sup>, 2<sup>2</sup>, 2<sup>3</sup> (1, 2, 4, 8), the final value eventually settles down to the number 3.

There are many, many relationships, patterns, values, and functions in this simple triad, but for many of them it is hard to say which of their products are *data* and which are *information*, as the Tholonic model defines those concepts.

## Reconstruction

If we rebuild the I Ching from the ground up, integrating elements from the I Ching, the Tholonic model, and Western philosophy, we get something like the following:

##### *Note: As mentioned numerous times before, the interpretations, values and relationships shown here are not intended to be conclusive. While I tried to make them as meaningful as possible, they are more used as examples. There are many ways patterns and relationships can be formed and I am sure a better version than the one presented here can be made.

<center><img src='../Images/tholonic-pakua-desc.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

Here are some points about this model:

The 8 trigrams (this is called the *Pa Kua* in the I Ching) are arranged in their binary, or natural order in pairs. The trigrams advance as opposite pairs of 0-7 <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b00.png' style='width:30px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b07.png' style='width:30px'/>, 1-6 <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b01.png' style='width:30px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b06.png' style='width:30px'/>, 2-5 <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b02.png' style='width:30px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b05.png' style='width:30px'/>, and 3-4 <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b03.png' style='width:30px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b04.png' style='width:30px'/> in the clockwise direction. This means the first 4 trigrams are 0, 1, 2, 3, <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b00.png' style='width:30px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b01.png' style='width:30px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b02.png' style='width:30px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b03.png' style='width:30px'/> and the next 4 trigrams are 7, 6, 5, 4 <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b07.png' style='width:30px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b06.png' style='width:30px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b05.png' style='width:30px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b04.png' style='width:30px'/>. This results in a pattern where all opposing numbers always equal 7, the maximum number that can be represented in binary using three places.

**Ring 7**: There are three divisions per quadrant representing the three stages of tholonic movement; *Negotiation*, *Definition*, and *Contribution* (ring 7). However, it is more accurate to say there are three *phases* or cycles of movement, conceptually similar to how three phase electricity works. All three phases are present all the time at every point, just at different points in the cycle, and presumably in the (archetypal) order of the image below.


<center><img src='../Images/three_phase_waveform.png' style='width:60%'/></center>

The two major axes are represented by the four cardinal points. The vertical axis is represented by the most extreme trigrams (7<img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b07.png' style='width:30px'/>, 0<img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b00.png' style='width:30px'/>) for the “north” and the “south,” and the horizontal axis by the most balanced trigrams (5<img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b05.png' style='width:30px'/>, 2<img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b02.png' style='width:30px'/>) for the “east” and “west.”

**Ring 1**: The other 4 trigrams (ring 1) are the most imbalanced and are therefore more unstable/dynamic.

The vertical and horizontal axis *reflects*, and the horizontal axis *reflects* as well as *reverses* (like a photo negative). This is why the lines in the east are a mirror of the lines in the west. This is also true for the lines in the north and the south, but in addition, they are also reversed along the horizontal axis, like a photo negative.


<center><img src='../Images/mirror.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

There are four quadrants, each with three stages, which are defined by the sequential lines (ring 6) of the intermediary trigram (ring 1). Each positive line is matched with its opposite negative line.

**Ring 5:** Because the first 4 trigrams (<img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b00.png' style='width:30px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b01.png' style='width:30px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b02.png' style='width:30px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b03.png' style='width:30px'/>) all have yin lines at the top-most position in the trigram we refer to them as ascending because they begin at 0 and ascend towards 7. Likewise, the next 4 trigrams (<img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b07.png' style='width:30px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b06.png' style='width:30px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b05.png' style='width:30px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b04.png' style='width:30px'/>) have yang lines in their top-most positions, so we call these descending because they start with 7 and descend towards 0.

**Ring 4**: The upper hemisphere is yang and the lower is yin (ring 4). Because the upper hemisphere consists of 4 yang lines and 2 yin line (ring 6) and has the cardinal value of 7 (ring 8), it is predominantly yang in nature. The opposite is true for the lower hemisphere which is predominantly yin in nature.

## The Origin of Trigrams

We have yet to look closely at how a trigram evolves from nothing. Below is a binary tree that begins with a point of unity that divides itself into two states, 0 and 1. This establishes the most fundamental concept of yin and yang. This is then followed by each of those children doing the same by creating their own two children of 0 and 1. We can see that there are now 4 children, each defined by the parent’s fundamental yin or yang, and then adding to that the yin or yang of the child. These 4 children have the values 0, 2, 1, 3, as shown by the bigrams. This is done one more time to create the final branch of 8 children, each with a value determined by adding their yin or yang value to the bigrams passed down by the parents. Now we have 8 trigrams: 0, 4, 2, 3, 6, 1, 5, 3, 7. Unfortunately, this order seems to lack any symmetry or pattern that is compatible with our model, suggesting it is incorrect.


<center><img src='../Images/btree-top.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

However, if we flip the tree upside down, like a mirror image, the order immediately appears! This is important when we are adding lines, because if we start with <img src='../Images/bc/bigram00.png' style='width:30px'/> and add a <img src='../Images/bc/yang.png' style='width:30px'/>, you might expect we get a <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b04.png' style='width:30px'/>, but as we will need to flip it to maintain the “mirrored” order, we will actually get a <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b01.png' style='width:30px'/>. Now we can see the first order of \[01\], the 2<sup>nd</sup> order of \[0123\], and the final and 3<sup>rd</sup> order of \[01234567\]. Of course, we could also achieve this order if we only added new lines below the previous lines, with the first line being at the top, but that would not be consistent with the I Ching hexagrams.


<center><img src='../Images/btree-bottom.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

This little example shows us that the I Ching is suggesting that the order of creation is one of bottom-up, not top-down. The top-down order is a mirror image of the bottom-up order and vice versa, and the top-down order, while being a perfect mirror of the bottom-up order, makes no sense in a top-down view of reality. It is also suggestive of one perspective being a chaotic pattern, and its reflection being an ordered pattern.

Now that we have our model in order, we can see if our trigrams fit into it in any way that makes sense. We do this simply by assigning the names of the trigrams that have the same values, while also assigning the first two branches of 0 and 1 to be that of the two branches of the tholonic trigram, like this:


<center><img src='../Images/attr-btree.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

We may run into a problem of semantics and context using the words *Definition* and *Contribution* in this binary framework. The words yin and yang seem to fit much better, but it is difficult to say *Definition* is yin and *Contribution* is yang, as both can be both depending on the context. For now, we will say *Definition* is yin in the way that it limits the expression, and *Contribution* is yang in the way that it is returning some creation back to the parent.

The problems of the semantics of duality have been around a long time, so we will defer to the wisdom of those who wrestled with this problem from the past

-   The two faces of *Shakti*; *Sambhuthi* (that which is manifested, yang, contributing) and *Asambhuti* (that which is not manifested, yin, defining/limiting).
-   
-   The Zoroastrian’s *Ahura Mazda* (eternal spirit of creation, yang, contributing) and *Angra Mainyu* (spirit of destruction, yin, defining/limiting).
-   
-   The Persian *Manichaeism*, where the first creation was that of the World of Light, “good”, ruled by the *Father of Greatness* (yang, contributing) and the the *World of Darkness*, “evil”, ruled by the *King of Darkness* (yin, defining/limiting).

There are countless examples, but here we would like to stay away from religious concepts, so we will refer to the primal binary as simply the *Defining Yin* and the *Contributing Yang*. Perhaps the *Defining Yin* can also be considered *order*, or the movement of chaos to order, coming into form, creation, explicit; and the *Contributing Yang* can be considered *chaos*, or the movement of order to chaos, dissolution of form, implicit, return to the source.

We can see that every bigram creates two trigram children, and this pair of trigrams is always made up of one cardinal element and one dynamic element. This suggests that the parent is both a state (cardinal/stable) and an energy (dynamic/unstable) combined. This is not far off from the two properties that created the zero-dimensional point, where the state is the *awareness* of the concept of a point, and the energy is the *intention* to conceive it. Both of these qualities exist in the bigram but can only find separation in the (trigram) children. We can also see that the nature of the energy is compatible with the nature of the state. Here we have a bit of a challenge because we do not have good words that describe these states and their movement, similar to the way “balance” is a state and a movement. Computer programming languages do have such a concept. It is called a “class,” and a class contains both static information and the dynamic code that can act on that information. We will have to make do with some borrowed and creative nouns and verbs.

For example, what can we call the parent that has the combined state of EARTH and an energy of *Filling*? It would have to be some quality that is common to both of these things. I have chosen the word “**Absorb**” because the act of absorbing is the process of *Filling* (of the absorptive material), and the element of EARTH, being the perfect yin of 0, can only absorb and be filled. Readers may find better words or concepts to describe these pairs. Think of the ones used here as suggestions.

***Contract*** is used to describe the nature of WATER, because water, which always travels the path of least resistance, will always pool, *Collecting* at the lowest point. Of course, all energy travels the path of least resistance, but WATER is meant to describe that property, so we can say that all energy has the property of WATER.

***Consume*** describes the nature of FIRE, as it consumes, or uses up or *empties* its fuel. This is almost the textbook definition of *Emptying*.

***Expand*** describes the nature of AIR, as it will expand into every place of existence to the edge of the universe. AIR here does not simply mean the air we breathe, but refers more to the space that exists between all things, be they atoms or planets. If one considered the expanding universe as a function of AIR, which was itself a function of the Big Bang, the verb of *Release* fits nicely. From this perspective, AIR might also be the element of dark matter.

Here are the properties of the 4 bigrams:


<center><img src='../Images/bigrams-ele.png' style='width:20%'/></center>

Let’s recap how we are describing the elements and processes of the eight trigrams.

We have arrived at the first pair, the original 0 and 1, the parents of all things, which, according to the Tholonic model, have the two attributes of the primal yin as DEFINITION and the primal yang as CONTRIBUTION. Here, DEFINITION refers to the limits that everything that exists must exist within. These are defined by the laws of physics and nature, the environment, the available resources, the integration with other processes, and, of course, the limitation and definition of form itself with its three dimensions. CONTRIBUTION refers to what the creation in question returns to the source from which it came. Various models imply various ways to understand the purpose of existence. The Tholonic model seems to be suggesting that the purpose of existence, and of life, is to be able to contribute back to the parent, the source, from which all creation sprung.

Here is an alternative way of looking at this model. Notice how all the horizontal pairs of pink dots equal 7, and all the pairs of orange dots equal 3, and how descriptions are opposite in nature for every pair.


<center><img src='../Images/btree-circ.png' style='width:60%'/></center>

With the introduction of bigrams, let’s look at the order of the trigrams again.


<center><img src='../Images/8-fold-1.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

The chart below shows the two dimensions of the bigram as described by their children. The cardinal elements are across the top, and the dynamic properties down the side. Using what we know about the trigrams, we can deduce the nature of the bigrams. You might also notice that the bigrams are identical to the two leftmost values of the boolean logic statement “011 AND 010 = 01.” This is called Boolean Algebra and was first conceived by George Boole (1854) in the book “*An Investigation of the Laws of Thought*” and was incorporated into electrical circuits about 100 years ago.


<center><img src='../Images/elementsgrid.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

While there may be many ways to create order of the trigrams, the Tholonic model continually re-validates itself every time we look at it from a different perspective. How, then, do these trigrams relate to a tholon? If we mapped the binary values to the tholon, the relationship is obvious and powerful, as shown in the graphic below.


<center><img src='../Images/tri-tholon.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

Here are some of the points spelled out:

-   The same two I Ching trigrams of 1 <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b01.png' style='width:30px'/> *Filling* and 6 <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b06.png' style='width:30px'/> *Release* exist in both the top triad and the opposing bottom <u>CD</u> edge. In the top triad they exist as the lower trigram *inner filling* and the upper trigram *outer release* to create hexagram 42䷩*~49~* **Increase**, wherein it states:

> *Sacrifice on the part of those above for the increase of those below*

Across the bottom <u>CD</u> edge, they are arranged as the lower trigram of *inner release* and the upper trigram as *outer filling* to create the hexagram 32䷟*~14~* **Duration**, wherein it states:

> *Duration is rather the self-contained and therefore self-renewing movement of an organized, firmly integrated whole, taking place in accordance with immutable laws and beginning anew at every ending.*

These two definitions are remarkably in sync with the tholonic arrangement shown.

-   Every corner hexagram value (28, 42, 49, or 7×4, 7×6, 7×7) which is yang in nature, is inverted on its opposite edge (35, 21, 14, or 7×5, 7×3, 7×2), which are yin in nature.

-   The two extremes, 7 <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b07.png' style='width:30px'/>and 0 <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b00.png' style='width:30px'/>, are in the center as 12䷋*~56~* **Standstill** of AIR above EARTH. This would appear to be a good candidate for the base of the tetrahedron.

-   The top hexagram in the position of *Negotiation* is that of 42䷩*~49~* **Increase** is composed of *Filling* and *Releasing*. In the position of *Definition* is *Fire and Water (available resources)*, and in the position of *Contribution* is that of *Collecting and Emptying*… and between them, on the axis of *Filling and Release*, which is exactly the same as the parent, they have created AIR and EARTH, the upper and lower limits of reality. The fact that AIR and EARTH create the hexagram 12䷋*~56~* **Standstill** does not bode well for us dwellers of the material reality, at least in the traditional translations from ***~~JWFIX~~***, as it more of a warning than anything else:

> *Heaven and earth are out of communion and all things are benumbed. What is above has no relation to what is below, and on earth confusion and disorder prevail. The dark power is within, the light power is without. Weakness is within, harshness without. Within are the inferior, and without are the superior. The way of inferior people is in ascent; the way of superior people is one the decline. But the superior people do not allow themselves to be turned from their principles. If the possibility of exerting influence is closed to them, they nevertheless remain faithful to their principles and withdraw into seclusion.*

Unfortunately, this same sentiment is shared by other enlightened voices:

-   Gnostic’s: *“He who has known the world has found a corpse; and he who has found a corpse, the world is not worthy of him.”* (Quoting Jesus, Nag Hammadi Text);
-   
-   The First Noble Truth of Buddha that *“Life is suffering”* (and the other three noble truths aren’t that optimistic either);
-   
-   The Christian Bible’s (Genesis 6:12) *“God observed all this corruption in the world, for everyone on earth was corrupt”*, a theme that returns many times;
-   
-   Hinduism’s Bhagavad-gita describes the world as a place *“full of miseries”*, and Krishna called it a *“place of distress”*.

The jury is pretty unanimous. However, in the “Tholonic I Ching,” this hexagram is called **Stagnation** and is interpreted as follows, which is far more accurate in describing the foundation of the material world, which is what this hexagram is representing in the tholon:

> > -   *The state of blockage that arises when expansion meets resistance. Like heaven’s energy blocked by earth, this represents the temporary cessation of flow that precedes necessary transformation.*
>
> -   *In the tholonic system, this hexagram represents the point where energy meets maximum resistance, creating potential for transformation. It demonstrates how consciousness can work with obstruction to create new pathways. From a tholonic perspective, “Stagnation” is perceived as the meeting of creative force with resistance. This scenario is an inherent occurrence within the cycles of expansion and limitation.*

The only point where all the elements (FIRE, WATER, AIR, EARTH) meet is along the side mapped to hexagram 64䷿*~42~* **Before Completion**, which is the last hexagram in the King Wen sequence, and is the inverse, or *descending* version of the “perfect” hexagram of 63䷾*~21~* **After Completion** where all the yin values are in yin positions and yang values are in yang positions, making it naturally *ascending*. The other two hexagrams along this axis are:

42䷩*~49~* **Increase**, “*Sacrifice on the part of those above for the increase of those below.*”

31䷞*~28~* **Wooing**, “*… their powers attract each other so that they unite*.”

## Binary Tholons

There is another way we can map the lines to a tholon, and that is simply by aligning the 6 lines of a hexagram to the 6 edges of a tetrahedron.


<center><img src='../Images/line-tetra.png' style='width:70%'/></center>

For the large outer triad, we start with the 1<sup>st</sup> vector, or edge, and move clockwise. For the inner triad, we continue with the 4<sup>th</sup> line and move counter-clockwise in the reverse direction. In the image above, each edge is assigned an I Ching line position. Immediately, you can see a few interesting relationships:

-   All opposing numbers equal 7.
-   The central lines of a hexagram, 2 and 5, and the central lines of tetrahedron.
-   The parent (1,3) is yang that creates a yin (2) spectrum, and the child (4,6) is a yin that creates a yang (5) spectrum.
-   The total for the yang is 3<sup>2</sup> (=9), and the total for the yin is 2<sup>2</sup>×3 (=12).
-   As a tetrahedron, it nicely positions all the yang lines central and foundational. However, it is not the obvious central triad that acts as the base of the tetrahedron, but the top triad. This is because it is the top triad of every 2D tholon map that always maintains the same pattern as the parent. This detail ensures that individual tholons have an orientation, but when the thologram is folded into itself, every side can act as any side.


<center><img src='../Images/pyramid-bottom.png' style='width:60%'/></center>

-   There are 4 triads created in this 2D tholon defined by the edges; lower right (2,4,1), center (4,5,6), lower left (3,6,2), and top (1,3,5). These create the 4 sides of the tetrahedron. These 4 sides naturally define 4 triads, <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b04.png' style='width:30px'/> (4), <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b02.png' style='width:30px'/> (2), <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b01.png' style='width:30px'/> (1), and <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b07.png' style='width:30px'/> (7), respectfully. Notice how the first three have yangs in the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> position, and the 4<sup>th</sup> triads has yangs in all 3 positions, in other words, the first 3 equal the 4<sup>th</sup> as 4+2+1=7. This would have to be the case if the point where they meet at the top, the *white dot*, had to contain all the properties of each contributing line. The values of these triads are the VI values, *values of instantiation*. However, if we look at their OI values as well, we see that 2 of these trigrams are the only 2 trigrams that have the same OI and VI values, those being <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b02.png' style='width:30px'/>(2) and <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b07.png' style='width:30px'/> (7). The other 2 trigrams, <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b04.png' style='width:30px'/> (4) and <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b01.png' style='width:30px'/> (1), also happen to be the mirror versions of each other. If we look at the OI/VI Chart above, we’ll see that these 4 pairs define each of the 3 axis required to create a tholonic trigram. This alone is interesting, but even more so how these three OI/VI pairs, 1-4, 2-2, 7-7, also implicitly define all trigrams.

## Hexagrams

With the hexagrams in their binary order, we can put together the 64 hexagrams (below). Some of the hexagrams are identified as being made of trigrams that are: <img src='../Images/trigram_colors.png' style='width:25%'/>

There are 2 pairs of *scope* hexagrams, which are those that are a product of those trigrams that define the scope. These are the *north-south* trigrams <img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB63.png' style='width:30px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB56.png' style='width:30px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB07.png' style='width:30px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB00.png' style='width:30px'/>.

There are 2 pairs of *context* hexagrams which are a product of the trigrams that define the context, or movement within that scope. These are the *east-west* trigrams <img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB45.png' style='width:30px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB42.png' style='width:30px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB21.png' style='width:30px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB18.png' style='width:30px'/>

There are 8 pairs *transitional* hexagrams, which are a product of the transitional trigrams.

The remaining 20 pairs are a mixture of dissimilar trigrams.


<center><img src='../Images/64hexagrams-4.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

Each quadrant above contains 16 hexagrams, but if we were to map these to the four sides of a tetrahedron, we would need exactly 15 hexagrams for a side. This can be easily accomplished if we isolate the four cardinal hexagrams as coordinate markers that define the area, but are not in the area. This is shown in the charts below where hexagrams 2*~0~* <img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB00.png' style='width:20px'/> and 1*~63~* <img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB63.png' style='width:20px'/> define the vertical min/max. These two hexagrams represent the points within which all the other hexagrams come into being. We now have 62 hexagrams that we need to put into 60 places, but another problem exists as well: when we fill each triad with hexagrams, the sum of the hexagrams in the three corners has to equal 63. Without this consistency, the three outer triads will not be able to create the 4^th^ inner triad, which must follow the same pattern in order to maintain homogeneity across all triads. This 4^th^ triad is equivalent to the 4<sup>th</sup> *white dot* point. It turns out that the solution to one problem automatically solves the other problem.


<center><img src='../Images/tetrahex.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

The obvious two children of the primal coordinate pair hexagrams are 11*~7~* <img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB07.png' style='width:20px'/> and 12*~56~* <img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB56.png' style='width:20px'/>, and we can confirm this because of all the 31 remaining possible pairs that together equal their parents; this is the only cardinal pair. In addition, these are the only hexagrams that are created by the two defining trigrams of <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b07.png' style='width:30px'/> and <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b00.png' style='width:30px'/>. As a coordinate pair, they are outside the *zone of change* (i.e., the 60 remaining hexagrams).

These children quite naturally fit into the larger triads pattern with 12*~56~* <img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB56.png' style='width:20px'/> *Standstill* as the N-state of the triad of *Limitation* (right triad) and 11*~7~* <img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB07.png' style='width:20px'/> *Peace* as the N-state of the triad of *Contribution* (left triad).

At first glance, this arrangement looks very promising, as the cardinal (blue-framed) hexagrams hold cardinal positions and the sum of their binary values equals 63 (actually, a multiple of 63, as 56 + 7 + 63 = 63 × 2). Arguably, 2*~0~* <img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB00.png' style='width:20px'/> and 1*~63~* <img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB63.png' style='width:20px'/> could be reversed, but the results are effectively the same.

However, several other validating patterns emerged that were pretty astounding.


<center><img src='../Images/tetrahex-hex-triplet-3.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

Notice that every value can be defined by a formula that only uses the first four prime numbers, or is itself a prime number! It was also a nice surprise that the sum of all values in the central tholonic trigram was 216, or 6×6×6, and 216/63=3.42857, which is $\frac{24}{7}$. It might just be a “coincidence” that this is how the ancient Egyptians and Babylonians (who also used a base-60 counting system) decided to measure hours per day and days per week, or perhaps they used a similar model to base their understanding on, rather than the commonly accepted reasoning that they arrived at 24 and 7 using approximate cycles of the moon, the limitations of sundials, and the seven celestial bodies.

Notice how each of the four child triads (or child tholons) in each parent triad (parent tholon) in ***Fig. h3a***, and by implication, ***Fig. h3***, have values (36, 27, 21, 42), which are also the natural pairs of 36, 27, *Dynamic Equilibrium* (green framed) and 21, 42, *Completion Cycle* (red framed). Notice also how the pair of *Dynamic Equilibrium* is on the vertical axis and the pair of *Completion Cycle* is on the horizontal axis.

52*~36~*<img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB36.png' style='width:20px'/>*Keeping Still* and 58*~27~*<img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB27.png' style='width:20px'/>*Joyous* (transitional, *Dynamic Equilibrium*)

63*~21~*<img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB21.png' style='width:20px'/>*After Completion* and 64*~42~*<img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB42.png' style='width:20px'/>*Before Completion* (balanced, *Completion Cycle*)

This is a quite remarkable association, as it perfectly describes the duality of movement and balance as the two axes within which the hexagrams exist. It also tells us that the movement precedes balance, as the values between the first duality of 2*~0~* <img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB00.png' style='width:20px'/> and 1*~63~* <img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB63.png' style='width:20px'/>, are those of *Dynamic Equilibrium* and the created children, that between 11*~7~* <img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB07.png' style='width:20px'/> and 12*~56~* <img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB56.png' style='width:20px'/>, creates the balance needed in the *Completion Cycle*.

This is just another of many patterns and relationships that confirm the validity of the tholonic structure of the hexagrams



Using this structure, we can create a sequence of the I Ching based on the Tholonic model above:


<center><img src='../Images/t-sequence.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

Some interesting points regarding the above sequence:

Because the four cardinal points define the framework and do not make up the dynamic part of the circle, there are exactly 60 points on the circle.

This is just like the ancient Babylonian clock, which introduced the idea of the 60-second minute and the 60-minute hour. The modern argument is that they used 360 as a basis because it represented their estimate for the number of days in a year, but this lazy reasoning presumes the ancient Babylonians, who were the masters in their day of navigation, architecture, agriculture, astronomy, and government, never bothered to actually count the days in a year, or worse, just ignored the extra days at the end. The reason the ancients used 60 is because 60 is one of the most fundamental numbers that drives nature, given that it is the product of the first three primes… 2<sup>2</sup>×3×5, and 2<sup>2</sup>×3=12, which is why we have a pair of 12 hours to the day, just like the Ancient Egyptians and Chinese developed. I will save you the embarrassingly myopic explanation offered by traditional modern thinking as to why and how these two cultures came up with the same system.

While the numbers are not sequential, each pair of opposites equals 63

I have added the octal (base 8) value because it is far more clear. Base-8, if you are not familiar with it, is simply a number system that is based on the eight values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. This means when you are counting and you get to 8, you have to start with the double digits, so our base-10 number 8 in octal is written as “10”.


<center><img src='../Images/decoct.png' style='width:70%'/></center>

The beauty of using octal numbers for the I Ching is the number itself is telling you what trigrams it’s made of. For example, hexagram 12 (001100) is octal **o**14 (we use ‘o’ for octal numbers). Hexagram 12 is composed of two trigrams: 001 and 100. We convert from binary to octal: b001 = o1, and b100 = o4. Then we simply put the two numbers next to each other to get o14. This ability to add numbers just by putting them together only works when converting binary base<sub>2</sub>, octal base<sub>8</sub>, hexadecimal base<sub>16</sub>, base<sub>32</sub>, or any base that is a power of 2. Perhaps that is why some ancient Native American and Proto-Indo-European cultures chose to use the octal system.

Numbers are not as intuitive as images, so here are a couple of charts based on the above sequence that clearly show the self-similarity triad pattern of the sequence

The graph on the left (below) plots each of the quadrants in the sequence above by the position in the sequence. Each quadrant has 15 positions (the Y axis), and there are 64 hexagrams (the X axis). The self-similar pattern of a larger triad whose two sides are made of smaller triads becomes quite clear. The middle plot shows the outline of that same plot, showing an extended or virtual self-similar pattern in light gray, which is better shown in the rightmost plot.

These plots show how the I Ching almost reconstructs the Thologram from scratch.

## Cross-Models: Astrology and the I Ching

The fundamental structure that the I Ching and related Eastern thinking is built on is essentially the same as the model for astrology and related Western thinking. This is not at all surprising, as both cultures were observing the same laws and patterns in action. However, if we find where they combine and overlap, we can understand one model that encompasses both.

In astrology, each sign is assigned an element property of FIRE, EARTH, AIR, or WATER, and a characteristic of Cardinal, Fixed, or Mutable. This makes twelve signs. We can easily see how the 6 lines of the I Ching/thologram would fit neatly into twelve, but if we want to understand the why's and how's, we have to go deeper. The first requirement for association is not only that the six lines have to map to twelve signs, but the twelve signs need to be mapped to a *complete* tholon, which is a tholon map and its virtual double.

We start by assigning the most fundamental concepts of the I Ching, which are 1 <img src='../Images/bc/yang.png' style='width:35px'/> and 0 <img src='../Images/bc/yin.png' style='width:35px'/> and their virtual counterparts, to the most fundamental signs of astrology, which are the cardinal signs in the following manner:

**Cardinals**

*Contribution/Definition* is the tholonic polarity that creation exists within. Aires, the first fire sign and only cardinal fire sign, is mapped to *Contribution*. Fire is the definition of contribution as it gives at a cost to itself. Fire is the contribution of light and heat at the sacrifice of that which keeps it alive. Capricorn, a cardinal earth sign, is ruled by the Great Limiter itself, Saturn, so there is no question that it fits in the space of *Definition* quite nicely. Aires and Capricorn are not opposite to each other, but they are the most dissimilar to each other and are perpendicular to each other. They represent two different dimensions. In this case the X-axis is the axis of 0 <img src='../Images/bc/yin.png' style='width:35px'/> and the Y-axis is the axis of 1 <img src='../Images/bc/yang.png' style='width:35px'/>.

The virtual counterpart to Aires, or the reflection of Aires' energy, is Libra, the sign of equilibrium and balance. This is poetically satisfying as the act of fire is the process of a transformation that ends in balance. This is the spectrum or axis of ***I Am↔I Balance***. The virtual counterpart of Capricorn is the nurturing and protective Cancer, which created the ***I Use↔I Feel*** axis.

**Fixed and Mutable**

Leo, like the sun that rules it, is the instantiation of fire, and like all instances, it is limited by its context: think sun vs. campfire. Its virtual counterpart is the world-changing, innovative Aquarius. This is the ***I Will↔I Know*** spectrum.

Taurus consuming nature’s counterpart is the penetrating Scorpio. This is the ***I Have ↔ I Desire*** spectrum.

The counterpart to the wise Sagittarius is the witty Gemini, creating the ***I Understand ↔ I Think***

The counterpart to the analytical Virgo is the edge-surfing Pisces, creating the ***I Analyze↔I Believe*** spectrum


<center><img src='../Images/astrigridv2_1.png' style='width:80%'/></center>

In the above chart, we assign the same yin/yang values for the elements and tholonic descriptions as we have been using all along. NEGOTIATION has no value (because it is both values combined). In the lower left of each cell is the binary value (and the decimal equivalent) of the column and row. In the left two columns, we have six cells made up of two primary lines and four cells made up of bigrams. The right is the inverse equivalent, which is consistent with the scheme of duality that exists in both models.

We have to decide in what order the binary values should be assigned. For example, column EARTH and row DEFINITION have a value of either 10 or 01, depending on which comes first: the column or the row. How do we choose the order? The first thing to understand is that either order is correct, as they are two different perspectives of the same thing. In our case, we want to select the order that displays the most symmetry and coherence.

<img src='../Images/math2.png' style='float:right;width:20%'/>If we list the vales as col/row vs. row/col we see that the col/row values have a more symmetry and pattern than the row/col values. For this reason we will use col/row method in order to find their position in the tholon (below left). The right (below) image shows the astrological associations based on those numbers, as we described above. The signs that are only 1 <img src='../Images/bc/yang.png' style='width:35px'/> and 0 <img src='../Images/bc/yin.png' style='width:35px'/> form the 4 outside boundaries, and the bigrams are contained inside the tholon.


<center><img src='../Images/tho-ast-bin.png' style='width:80%'/></center>

The cardinal signs, which only have one line (1 <img src='../Images/bc/yang.png' style='width:35px'/> and 0 <img src='../Images/bc/yin.png' style='width:35px'/>) correlate to all the NEGOTIATION signs and neatly fit perfectly. For example, the left side of the upper tholon is made up of EARTH-FIRE-EARTH, and the one boundary they all share is the cardinal EARTH sign of Capricorn. Additionally, the diagonal axis that crosses into the virtual (lower) tholon is the boundary between Leo and Taurus, which are equidistant to the Capricorn cusp. This axis crosses into the lower right area of the virtual tholon, which is AIR-AIR-WATER and is between Gemini and Aquarius, also equidistant from their common border of cardinal AIR sign of Libra. This is the pattern we see for all four quadrants. Also significant is that the NEGOTIATION signs, which are those that correlate to a child N-state, create the spectrum capable of creating new children and form the outer boundary. All non-N-state signs converge to the tholonic N-cluster in the middle of the resulting hexagrams, creating the central or parent N-state.



<img src='../Images/tho-ast-bin_leo_aqu_zod.png' style='float:right;width:100%'/>An historically interesting observation that related to the two central triangles that connect in the center of the astrological tholon presented above is how Leo/Aquarius cusp used to be considered the dividing line between the two sides of the zodiac and Aquarius. In the image above, the zodiac is rotated to make that line vertical.  Contrary to intuitive assumption that the dividing line that reflects the planetary qualities would be aligned to the cardinal points of the four seasons, or the spring/fall equinoxes and the summer/winter, it’s actually off by 30° from the solstice and 60° of the equinox, making the planetary patters appear somewhat asymmetric to the zodiac.

However, the three axes formed by the divisions of the 12 signs into sets of elements, i.e., a new division for each set of the four elements, show a pattern that is quite obvious in the tholonic view. The two additional diagonal divisions in the zodiac chart are shown as the outer borders of the tholonic chart. That, in itself, is validating, but what was unexpected was where the spring equinox appears in the realigned zodiac chart, which is at the 4:00 mark, which, as we saw earlier, is the “time” when the new cycle of the day begins.

You might be thinking, *"That can't be true because if you are moving in a clockwise motion, then you are traveling through the zodiac backward. And if you flip the zodiac to compensate for that, then the spring equinox is not at 4:00 but at 8:00."* This would be a correct observation if we were looking at the cycle of a single year. However, if we consider the *precession of the equinoxes*, a 25,772-year cycle in which Earth's rotational axis shifts gradually, causing the equinox positions to move westward, this changes the perspective. The precession moves opposite to the yearly eastward movement of the zodiac signs, meaning that this reverse motion through the signs as we travel in a clockwise direction is perfectly accurate.

Now we have a time frame that applies to both models, within which all potential relationships between the planets and the zodiac unfold. The 4:00 mark represents the beginning of a new cycle, which starts with the *Age of Pisces*, officially beginning around *1 BCE to 1 CE*.

This is also the first evidence (that I have ever seen) that shows that the procession of the equinoxes could be inferred by simply looking at the zodiac model, and that the

For those interested in such things, if 4:00 starts a new cycle, then our last “midnight” was 8,650 BCE, which marked the end of the Younger Dryas and Pleistocene Ice Age and a transition into the Holocene Epoch, and humanity’s transition into agriculture, permanent settlements, such as Gobekli Tepe in Turkey and Jericho (Palestine/West Bank), one of the world’s oldest continuously inhabited cities, which was being established around this time. This would have also been shortly after the proposed catastrophic events [^3][^4][^5][^6][^7][^8][^9][^10] that caused the sudden mass extinction of large animals and possibly erased many advanced civilizations, according to some hypotheses [^11][^12].

> One minor difference between the western and eastern models is that while they both reflect and invert to create the complete picture, they do it a little differently, which makes a perfect mapping less obvious with the existing models. The I Ching and astrology is such as example, but via the thologram, it is possible.
>
> Looking at the monogram and bigram numbers of the signs, as determined by their tholons, there does not seem to be much of a pattern: 1, 2, 1, 0, 3, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 3, 0.


<center><img src='../Images/zodgrid.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

However, if we arrange them in a circle and color them to represent the *Negotiation*, *Definition*, *Contribute* elements, the tholonic and binary information becomes quite clear


<center><img src='../Images/numberwheel.png' style='width:50%'/></center>

In this form, we can see several patterns:

- All values are equal to their opposite value with respect to the cardinal axes.

- The single NEGOTIATION (blue) points, which represent the points from which new children can be produced, are 1 <img src='../Images/bc/yang.png' style='width:35px'/> and 0 <img src='../Images/bc/yin.png' style='width:35px'/> and are in cardinal positions.

- The 2s <img src='../Images/bc/bigram10.png' style='width:35px'/> and 3s <img src='../Images/bc/bigram11.png' style='width:35px'/> occupy the DEFINING (green) points and only appear once, unlike the 1/0s which appear twice. 

- 3 represents the most energized, or extreme yang state, and is that same axis that divides the planets in the traditional astrological layout.

- The second set of 1 and 0 are made of the bigrams <img src='../Images/bc/bigram01.png' style='width:35px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/bigram00.png' style='width:35px'/>, and these represent the CONTRIBUTE (red) points, which are the points that return to the N-state, so 1s and 0s leave the N-state as a single line of 0 or 1, yin or yang, but return to the N-state as a bigram also of 0 or 1, yin or yang.

## The Lines

*Note: Except for the graphic at the end of this chapter, the red and blue text used below is not related to the RGB colors of the tholon as has been used up until now. They were chosen for their ease of readability and contrast*.

There is another reason why we bring up astrology, and that is because, as we can see in the number wheel above and the tholon model, it is based on six pairs of attributes that define and describe a complete journey through the cycle, and which happen to map neatly onto the six lines of change in the I Ching. If we apply the rules of the tholonic I Ching and binary models to astrology, we get the chart shown below.


<center><img src='../Images/tho-zod.png' style='width:70%'/></center>

It works like this: All blue characters are YANG in nature, and all red are YIN. All yellow backgrounds are INNER in nature and correspond to the REAL or upper triad of the tholon, and all green backgrounds are OUTER and correspond to the VIRTUAL or lower triad of the tholon.

We can see that for a specific context, each tholonic property has four states; for example, NEGOTIATION in the context of NATURE can be *Active, Nurturing, Harmonious,* or *Ambitious.* These states represent the INNER-YANG, INNER-YIN, OUTER-YANG, and OUTER-YIN. Of these four states, the default (in bold) INNER-YIN is *Nurturing,* and the default OUTER-YANG is *Harmony.* A property in a context is default when the nature of the value is the same as the nature of the context, so a yin value in a yin context is the default value for that context.

Here is how we want to look at this graph as it applies to the hexagram.


<center><img src='../Images/tho-zod-2.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

To validate this, we can look at a few details, such as how the progression of the *Nature* column fits perfectly (in my humble opinion) for both the inner (yellow) and outer (green) definitions.

-   INCEPTION requires the balance of a negotiated state (Negotiation, Harmony).
-   SPECIFICATIONS must be unwavering, consistent and clear (Definition, Stability).
-   DEPLOYMENT requires a vision of what is being created and how it will integrate (Contribution, Visualization)
-   EMERGENCE requires careful consideration, for it is fraught with challenges and demands (Negotiation, Nurturing)
-   SYNTHESIS is where the creation finds it peak expression (Definition, Imagination).
-   DIFFUSION is the return to the source and the lasting effects (Contribution, Practicality)
-   

Let’s make this even simpler to illustrate another point.

<center><img src='../Images/tho-zod-3.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

If we were to apply the above charts to hex 64*~21~*<img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB21.png' style='width:20px'/>*After Completion* and 63*~42~*<img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB42.png' style='width:20px'/>*Before Completion* using the values from the *Nature* and *Personal* columns, we would get the following:

<center><img src='../Images/tho-zod-4.png' style='width:80%'/></center>

This shows that, according to the Tholonic model using traditionally Western values, the archetype of INCEPTION in a “Natural” context is *Harmony*, and its inverted concept, *Activity*. Likewise, on a more individual, subjective front, the archetype of INCEPTION is *I Balance*, and its inverted concept, *I Am*. Looking at all the pairs, we see the same well-matched dualities.

There is still one last step, and that is to reduce the twelve pairs down to six pairs. This is fairly easy, and it looks something like the left image in the graph below. We have added the blue text circle to describe the qualities of the pair of the previously opposing six pairs, or twelve attributes, of Western astrology. It’s obvious how these six *uber* attributes match well with the pink circle that lists the I Ching’s attributes for the six lines.

On the right is the graph shown earlier that describes the eight trigrams. Here we have together the model for trigrams and the model for the lines. The lines model (left) is based on the *tholonic tree*, where we begin with 1, which creates 2 more, which is mirrored, creating 6, and then inverted, which creates 12. The trigram model (right) is a *binary tree*, beginning with 1, which creates 2, each of which creates 2 (4), each of which creates 2 (8).

# Section IV: Synthesis

## How Creation Works

We are going to zoom way out now to get an even broader, but more in-depth picture of the natural processes in play in the hopes it will add insight into the Tholonic model and the I Ching.

The Tholonic model is rooted in the ancient principle that from singularity arises duality. This is evident in the idea that *nothingness* has no meaning until *something* emerges, at which point *nothingness* can be defined as 0 and *somethingness* as 1. Without *something*, the very notion of *nothing* would not exist, as *nothingness* is only meaningful in contrast to its opposite. Rather than engaging in the unresolved debate over which came first—nothingness or somethingness—we recognize that before *something* appeared, the question of whether *nothing* existed is not only unanswerable but also meaningless, as the very concept of existence presupposes contrast.

The concepts of 1 and 0 are the simplest and most practical concepts to represent this contrast of duality. In the context of mathematics, the sum of the parts of a whole equals the whole, so we can then say that 1 + 0 = 1, which tells us the whole equals 1. This sounds like 1<sup>st</sup> grade math… but let’s continue.

We can plot this a few different ways:


<center><img src='../Images/numbers-1_1.png' style='width:50%'/></center>

If this is a true statement, then it must be true for all numbers. Let’s try this with the first, and only the first, 8 numbers, 0-7, by making every pair of numbers that equals 7: 7+0, 6+1, 5+2, and 4+3, just like how the original pair of opposites, 1 and 0, equal the value of the parent, which *must* be 1.


<center><img src='../Images/numbers-1_2.png' style='width:80%'/></center>

Now we have a problem because, as is shown in the above one-level tree chart, we have four 7s, which when split make all the numbers 0-7, but what then are the two parents of these four 7s? If we apply the same logic, then those four 7s would have the two parents of 14 (**o**16) and 14 (**o**16), making the originating parent 28 (**o**46), but this is not allowed as we have no numbers that are greater than 7. The problem is that any number we use as a parent number will never create two children that are the same number because the parent number *must* be odd to create different children. In addition, if the top number is even, the number of possible pairs is an odd number. For example, if 6 is the parent, we have 4 possible child pairs of 0-6, 1-5, 2-4, and 3-3, but 3-3 is not allowed as they are the same number, leaving 3 pairs. This breaks the binary symmetry, and we assume that this symmetry is a requirement based on the fact that the first number to represent something, 1, creates perfect symmetry.

The challenge is that there is no existing number to represent the parents. To solve this, we need to create new numbers—just as mathematics has done before with concepts like *imaginary numbers* and *pure imaginary numbers*, such as *i* (the square root of -1). Similarly, we will introduce our own set of imaginary numbers, which we will call *primordial numbers*.


<center><img src='../Images/number-chart.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

We need a number that can *simultaneously represent two (or more) distinct values that are inherently unequal*. This seemingly paradoxical requirement finds a close parallel in *quantum mechanics*. In quantum theory, a particle's state, such as *spin*, can exist in a *superposition*, holding multiple values at once until measured. Furthermore, *entanglement* demonstrates that two particles, regardless of distance, can be *correlated in a way that defies classical logic*. One particle’s measurement instantly determines the state of the other. This suggests that, at a fundamental level, reality does not always conform to a single, well-defined state but rather an *interdependent structure of potentialities*.

Similarly, our *primordial number* must function in a way that allows it to exist in multiple states at once, akin to a quantum superposition. For an accessible and insightful discussion of these ideas, see Quanta Magazine’s article *"Entanglement Made Simple"*.[^2]

[^2]: Quanta Magazine, *"Entanglement Made Simple,"* April 28, 2016. Available at https://www.quantamagazine.org/entanglement-made-simple-20160428/

We can now apply this idea to our tree of 7, going all the way to the top, where we have the meta-value, or *first-order primordial number*, of A, which represents one unit from which these eight numbers emerge in the following manner.

<center><img src='../Images/numbers-1_3.png' style='width:80%'/></center>

We start with A and its first pair, which consists of A<sub>0</sub> and A<sub>1</sub>. On the next row, each one of those meta-values has its own pair, so A<sub>0</sub> has A<sub>01</sub> and A<sub>00</sub>, etc.

*Note: Don’t be confused if you are looking at the binary sub-indexes and seeing they do not match the decimal values. They are not suppose to be the same. This is explained in the next paragraphs.*

This can be demonstrated better in the following circular charts.

<center><img src='../Images/numbers-1_4.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

At the bottom of the above tree, we have eight states of A, each identified by the sub-index value representing its unique lineage from A. If you understand binary numbers, you’ll notice that the sub-indexes follow the perfect sequential order of 76543210 (starting from the left), yet the number they represent has a very different order: 70615243. This seems to make no logical sense, but in fact, it is an amazing relationship.

The sub-index values represent the path of expression from A, or position within the tree, that resulted in a number value. This is the *order of instantiation* (*OI*), while the value itself is the *value of instantiation* (*VI*). Look at how these two sets of values relate to one another. Below (top left) are the binary and decimal values for the *OI* sub-indexes and the value, *VI*, of that number.

<img src='../Images/numbers-1_5_2.png' style='width:100%'/>

In the top right form, the *value of instantiation* (*VI*) axis is perpendicular to the *order of instantiation* (*OI*) axis. These two axes are perfectly in sync with each other in two different axes and seem to be a natural process of reordering in a very efficient form of encoding (and therefore decoding) as the *value of instantiation* is an encoded version of the *order of instantiation*, and vice versa.

This order of 7, 6, 5, 4,

We can see that no VI number can exist without having an implicit OI number, meaning each number must have two attributes: an attribute of how it is expressed (VI) and an attribute of how it came to exist (OI), and each of these must be unique.

The lower right form shows the four trigrams made of the parent and two children each. We still see the order, but it is in two sets. The lower left image shows how these values could be mapped to a tholon.

The relationship between *Order of Instantiation (OI)* and *Value of Instantiation (VI)* closely parallels the fundamental interplay between *electricity* and *magnetism* in physics. In electromagnetism, a changing electric field produces a magnetic field, and a changing magnetic field produces an electric field—two inseparable forces that always appear together and exist perpendicular to each other in space. Similarly, *OI* and *VI* exist in a perpendicular relationship, with *OI* representing the structured *path of emergence* and *VI* representing the *function* of a number—how it instantiates, interacts, and expresses itself within the system.

This duality extends to other fundamental principles in physics: in quantum mechanics, position and momentum are complementary attributes that cannot be fully understood in isolation, and in relativity, space and time form a unified framework that defines all events. Likewise, in this model, every number must possess both an *OI* (structural definition) and a *VI* (functional expression), and together, they create a complete instantiation system. Just as an electric field cannot exist without an accompanying magnetic field, a number’s *VI* or what it does cannot exist without its *OI* or how it came to be. Each defines the other, forming an interdependent and self-sustaining system.

This parallel extends beyond electromagnetism into other fundamental dualities in nature. In *quantum mechanics*, position and momentum are complementary attributes of a particle; one cannot be fully understood without the other. In *relativity*, space and time form a unified fabric, where an event is defined by both its location and when it occurs. Likewise, in your numerical model, every number has two defining attributes: one that describes its structure (OI) and one that describes its function (VI).

Another compelling observation is that the system exhibits properties of efficient encoding, much like how energy and information are optimized in physical systems. In electromagnetism, energy is encoded in oscillating waves; in thermodynamics, entropy and information are linked in a way that optimizes stability. The fact that this numerical structure appears to follow similar principles suggests that OI and VI are not arbitrary assignments but rather a natural law of emergence and encoding. The perpendicular relationship between them may reflect an optimal strategy for structuring information, akin to how complex systems naturally evolve toward stability and efficiency.

The significance of this duality suggests that the encoding of information in numbers follows a natural law of emergence, much like how electromagnetism encodes energy in waves. The perpendicular nature of OI and VI may reflect an efficient way for numerical systems to self-organize, much like how physical systems adopt the most stable and efficient configurations. This hints at a deeper *universal principle of structured emergence*, where the process by which something is instantiated is as fundamental as what it does once instantiated.

Technically speaking (and I need to say that because what comes next sounds quite esoteric, but it’s not meant to be), every instance, which is every *thing* that exists, is not only a piece of the *One Thing* that all existence came from. In this example, that would be the primal A. In the Tholonic model, that would be the 0-dimensional dot. In both cases, we see a recombination of the very path that caused an instance to come into existence starting from the beginning of creation. If there is one source or many sources from which everything grew, then every instance, every thing, has a unique *OI* value which describes the path it has taken from its source. Because every order of instantiation is unique, so too is the *VI*.

But there is one more perspective that is worth looking at. If we arrange this tree in its most natural evolving form (the synergetics of 60°), we get the following:

<center><img src='../Images/honeymap_2.png' style='width:90%'/></center>

—BEGIN

This OI/VI Chart reveals several fascinating structural and numerical relationships that suggest deeper underlying principles of emergence, encoding, and self-organization. These patterns not only provide insight into the tholonic I Ching but also reflect broader natural principles found in physics, information theory, and structured emergence, which we would expect.

We’ve already addressed the intrinsic law of structured emergence, where every number in this system has a unique OI-VI pairing, meaning that each number simultaneously holds two complementary attributes: its structural pathway (VI, *how* it emerged) and its functional role (OI, *what* it becomes). This duality falls squarely into the Limitation/Contribution spectrum and can be applied to, in some manner, top everything that exists, as we already have evidence of this in the wave-particle duality in quantum mechanics or the relationship between space and time in relativity, where one aspect defines and constrains the other.

A particularly unique pattern that emerges in this map is that 7 and 2 are the only values where OI and VI are identical. This means that for these two numbers, the process of *how* they emerged and *what* they ultimately became are fundamentally the same. Such a condition suggests that these numbers represent a kind of equilibrium within the system, where structure and function align perfectly. In self-organizing systems, equilibrium states are often critical points of stability, hinting that 7 and 2 play a special role in balancing or anchoring the system as a whole.

The role of 3/4 as an exception to the OI pattern further emphasizes the unique nature of 7. The OI values generally form a distinct hexagonal pattern, yet 3/4 does not integrate into this structure. Instead, the values 3 and 4 combine to form 7, which does appear within a larger hexagonal pattern. This means that 7 exists in two forms: once as a fusion of 3 and 4, and once as its own independent identity. Interestingly, the central position of 3+4 as 7 is only shared by the primal "A," suggesting a unique connection between them, possibly linked to the fundamental process of creation. Additionally, 7 (as 3+4) is the only OI value that emerges directly from the simplest duality, 0/1, reinforcing its role as a structurally significant number, as well as how 7 and 2 are points of equilibrium.

Looking at the two sets of maps on the right, we see that the OI values show significantly more order than their VI values. We know that one is a transformation of the other, so we might assume they would be equally ordered, but they are clearly not.

This may be because the OI values describe how things come into existence, making them more likely to follow a predictable structure. Alternatively, the VI transformation may not preserve the hierarchy. In this case, we can think of OI as structured emergence, like a blueprint, and VI as an organic system of creation, representing the movement of energy in the process of creation rather than a rigid framework.

There may be multiple ways to plot this pattern of the “living process,” but the most obvious and appropriate in this case would be to map the eight VI values onto two tetrahedrons, where every opposing pair of values equals 7, as shown below. Since two tetrahedrons form a cube, we can easily map the values to the cube

This reveals an interesting pattern, with all the odd numbers on the top and all the even numbers on the bottom, both following a specific direction of increment. Ultimately, we arrive at the classic symbol of infinity, which now has volume and a direction of movement.

<center><img src='../Images/VI_tetra.png' style='width:80%'/></center>

Now it appears that the VI pattern, which requires three dimensions, reveals a highly appropriate and specific representation of the movement of energy.

The infinity symbol (∞) was first used by the mathematician John Wallis (1655), inspired by the Roman symbol for 1,000 (CIƆ or M). However, its origins trace back as far as 1600 BCE in the Egyptian Ouroboros, the symbol of a serpent eating its own tail, representing eternity and endless cycles.

I suspect that the ancients may have known of this tetrahedral-cube-based origin as well, but that knowledge was lost over time.



Finally, the Tholonic nature of the system becomes evident in this graph, which suggests that OI and VI values can be mapped onto a Tholon. If OI represents definition or limitation (i.e., blueprints), defining the structured boundaries of emergence, and VI represents integration or contribution (i.e., movement of energy), the functional expression that integrates into the system, then this system naturally aligns with the NDC (Negotiation-Definition-Contribution) framework in the Tholonic model. This perspective supports the idea that OI and VI encode a universal principle of structured emergence, where the constraints that shape an instance (OI) are just as fundamental as the instantiated form ultimately takes (VI). The interplay between definition and integration, emergence and expression, further reinforces that the numerical relationships within the OI/VI system follow deep, self-organizing principles that mirror the fundamental laws of nature.

## DNA

We see these same patterns of progression in the most fundamental form of creation: genetics. Below is a graph that illustrates how the bases of adenine (*A*), cytosine (*C*), guanine (*G*), and thymine (*T*) pair together to form nucleotides. An *A* can only double bond with a *T*, and *C* can only triple bond with a *G*. This is accomplished by taking one side, inverting it (a negative image), then reversing it (horizontal flip). When we do that, the pairs automatically line up in their proper order. In the image below, we see the same concepts as above by considering the bases of *A, T, G, C* to be the instantiable form of some *meta-base*, or some instantiable archetype, such as the mate-base values that produce the numbers we saw above but are inexpressible. These are represented as the half-circles and full circles. We also assign sub-index values representing their paths, and, as you can see, every pair has two values that equal 3.

The intention is to show how at least one aspect of the mechanics of a DNA strand follows the same order, or pattern, of this archetype of *hierarchical primordial numbers* and that of many natural processes. For example, the parent of the bonded bases could be the concept of the class of compounds called purines or pyrimidines. Their parent, the source, could be the class of aromatic heterocyclic organic compounds, of which all the children are a member. Or perhaps it could be *Chargaff’s Rule*, which states, “DNA must have equal parts of GC and AT nucleotides.” There could be many different instances of these parents, but in every case, they will follow the same pattern of expression.


<center><img src='../Images/dna-clr.png' style='width:80%'/></center>

This inversion and reversal process is the same mechanism used in the I Ching, demonstrating how only 16 original hexagrams are needed to create 64 hexagrams, or rather, 32 inverted pairs of archetypes.

What is especially interesting is that the opposite (inverted and flipped) of the purine compound adenine is the pyrimidine compound thymine. This is significant because there cannot truly be an “opposite” of a compound, molecule, or atom in a strict chemical sense. However, there can be two compounds that function in an opposite manner within a specific context or task, where this “opposition” typically manifests as complementarity. In other contexts, these compounds behave very differently—such as how adenine is also used in cellular metabolism to transfer chemical energy between reactions.

From a Tholonic perspective, this demonstrates that the structure of a process is independent of the specific instances that apply it. This strongly suggests that the process archetype exists before it is instantiated.

This conclusion is a radical observation, as it implies that process and structure can exist independently of substance. In other words, DNA does not derive its form from the compounds that compose it—rather, the form exists as an archetype, and compounds that are compatible with that archetypal form naturally align with it.

We can validate this idea by identifying similar forms in DNA that also appear elsewhere. Many such examples exist in language and writing systems, neural networks and brain structures, crystals and quasicrystals, planetary and orbital resonance, economics and trade, software code, and computer algorithms, to name just a few.

There are correlations between the I Ching and DNA. For example, if we replace DNA concepts with I Ching concepts, we can say the following:


<center><img src='../Images/iching-dna.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

## Elements

In keeping with the traditional I Ching, we want to assign familiar real-world elements and properties. Using archetypes to describe a scene or function can be very helpful in tapping into our intuitive understanding. The traditional elements of the I Ching are: water, fire, wood, metal, and earth. These elements are traditionally said to work together in a sort of paper/rock/scissors manner:

> - Wood generates Fire, Fire generates Earth, Earth generates Metal, Metal generates Water and Water generates Wood.
>
> - Wood weakens Water, Water weakens Metal, Metal weakens Earth, Earth weakens Fire and Fire weakens Wood.
>
> - Wood controls Earth, Earth controls Water, Water controls Fire, Fire controls Metal and Metal controls Wood.
>
> - Wood insults Metal, Metal insults Fire, Fire insults Water, Water insults Earth and Earth insults Wood.

However, we are using Western *primordial* elements here as they are a better fit and are more flexible in general. For the cardinal points, we have the four classics of AIR, WATER, EARTH, and FIRE. We use all caps for these archetypes to distinguish them from the physical elements. These archetypes represent qualities and properties of the elements that can be found in anything, and not simply the physical instances of air, water, earth, and fire.

We have also adopted the astrological/Neo-Platonic qualities of these elements. Of course, any other definitions could be used to create interpretations that are consistent with other perspectives.


<center><img src='../Images/elements.png' style='width:80%'/></center>

### Here are the explanations of the cardinal and transitional elements with their reasoning and correlation with the triads.

### <img src='../Images/e_earth.png' style='width:30px'/>***EARTH*** <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b00.png' style='width:60px'/> 0

*EARTH* represents the foundation upon which everything is built as well as the resources from which they are built. It is cardinal, winter solstice, inward, the non-moving point between deflation and inflation. Instances of this are **resources**, **foundations**, **support**.

The trigram shows the symbol of a perfect yin state.

The quadrant of EARTH <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b00.png' style='width:30px'/> exists between the dynamic properties of *Emptying* <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b04.png' style='width:30px'/> and *Filling* <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b01.png' style='width:30px'/> and therefore represents the extreme yin pole, where the maximum point of *Emptying* is reached and where *Filling* begins. In this way, it is also a tipping point

1.  **Negotiation** <img src='../Images/bc/yin.png' style='width:30px'/>
In the context of Earth, a yin Negotiation represents a passive yet fertile foundation, ready to receive and shape whatever is introduced. Like soil awaiting a seed, it does not impose restrictions on what it can accept, but the nature of what grows depends on the surrounding conditions. Just as a swamp lily will struggle in a desert, the environment itself negotiates what can take root and thrive.
2.  **Definition** <img src='../Images/bc/yin.png' style='width:30px'/>
A yin Definition in the context of Earth signifies a state shaped entirely by external influences. It does not impose its own structure but provides the foundation upon which all else is built. Like clay in the hands of a potter or water conforming to its container, Earth as yin Definition is formed by the forces that act upon it. It remains receptive while offering stability to whatever takes shape upon it.
3.  **Contribution** <img src='../Images/bc/yin.png' style='width:30px'/>
In the context of Earth, a yin Contribution provides the space and conditions necessary for yang to emerge. It does not act directly but enables creation by its presence alone. Just as zero defines the space in which one can exist or emptiness allows form to arise, Earth’s contribution is its stability and receptivity, forming the foundation upon which all else is built.

### <img src='../Images/e_water.png' style='width:30px'/>***WATER*** <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b02.png' style='width:60px'/> 2

*Water* represents the movement from darkness to light, yin to yang, lifelessness to life. It is cardinal, associated with the spring equinox, the season of ascending energy and renewal. Water embodies the perfect balance of lessening yin and increasing yang, symbolizing flow, adaptability, and transformation. Instances of this include **electricity**, **nourishment**, **cleansing**, and **rivers**.

The quadrant of Water <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b02.png' style='width:30px'/> exists between the dynamic properties of Filling <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b01.png' style='width:30px'/> and Collecting <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b03.png' style='width:30px'/>. It represents the balance between yin and yang, achieved when yang penetrates yin at its center. Oceans and lakes fill and become still, but water collects and returns to the river, initiating movement that naturally flows back to its source. Water is the most inward-moving of all states, always seeking depth and unity.

The trigram shows the symbol of yang energy penetrating yin at its core, illustrating that water, though yielding, is defined by movement and flow.

1. **Negotiation** <img src='../Images/bc/yin.png' style='width:30px'/>
In the context of Water, a yin Negotiation represents absolute adaptability. Water does not resist—it cedes to whatever holds it, taking the shape of its container. However, this is not passivity but a dynamic flexibility, allowing it to move through, around, and even erode what confines it.

- **Definition** <img src='../Images/bc/yang.png' style='width:30px'/>
A yang definition in the context of Water signifies that movement is its defining characteristic. Water exists only in motion, whether as a river carving valleys, currents shaping the ocean, or electricity flowing through a circuit. Unlike Earth, which defines through structure, Water defines through its ability to move, change, and sustain.

- **Contribution** <img src='../Images/bc/yin.png' style='width:30px'/>
In the context of Water, a yin Contribution is its ability to give without depletion. Water follows the path of least resistance, nourishing all life and ecosystems before returning to its source, essentially unchanged yet transformative. It takes nothing, yet gives everything, embodying the nature of growth, renewal, and expansion.

### <img src='../Images/e_wind.png' style='width:30px'/>Air <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b07.png' style='width:60px'/> 7

Air represents the arena of growth and creation. What emerges from the yin of Earth expands into the yang of Air. It is the force that holds all things in place, yet it is also symbolic of spirit, revealing a life that extends beyond earthly limitations. It is cardinal, associated with the summer solstice, and represents outward expansion. Air is the non-moving point between inflation and deflation, the moment of fullness before release. Instances of this include **birth**, **exploration**, and **imagination**.

The trigram shows the symbol of a perfect yang state. Air is one of the three trigrams that serve as an originating source, meaning it is a force of initiation and expansion.

The quadrant of Air <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b07.png' style='width:30px'/> exists between the dynamic properties of Collecting <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b03.png' style='width:30px'/> and Releasing <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b06.png' style='width:30px'/>. It represents the turning point where the internal journey transitions into the external journey. This is the extreme yang pole, the moment when the process of Collecting reaches its maximum, and Releasing must soon begin.

1. **Negotiation** <img src='../Images/bc/yang.png' style='width:30px'/>
In the context of Air, a yang Negotiation seeks movement, expansion, and creation. Air does not settle; it actively explores, reaching outward to interact with the yin. Just as the wind finds every gap and fills every space, Air is in constant search of new frontiers, never bound by limitations.

- **Definition** <img src='../Images/bc/yang.png' style='width:30px'/>
A yang definition in the context of Air arises through discovery. The unknown is yin in nature, but the act of exploring it is yang. It is only by venturing into the unknown that boundaries are defined and limitations are revealed. Like the first breath of life or the expansion of thought, Air moves forward without hesitation, shaping its world by uncovering its edges.

- **Contribution** <img src='../Images/bc/yang.png' style='width:30px'/>
In the context of Air, a yang Contribution is the force that opens new doors and reveals new horizons. Air does not preserve the past; it propels existence forward, clearing away the stagnant and bringing fresh energy. Just as the wind carries seeds to distant lands or ideas spread through inspiration, Air’s contribution is the endless renewal of possibilities.

### <img src='../Images/e_fire.png' style='width:30px'/>***FIRE*** <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b05.png' style='width:60px'/> 5

Fire represents the force that allows manifestation, transforming idea into form. It is cardinal, associated with the fall equinox, and represents descent and release. It embodies the perfect balance of lessening yang and increasing yin, symbolizing transformation, consumption, and illumination. Instances of this include **light** and **consumption**.

The trigram shows the symbol of yang on the outside but is dependent on a yin center, much like a fire that shines light while consuming its fuel. As the yang dissipates, the form it sustained is reduced to ashes, revealing the cyclical nature of creation and destruction.

The quadrant of Fire <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b05.png' style='width:30px'/> exists between the dynamic properties of Releasing <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b06.png' style='width:30px'/> and Emptying <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b04.png' style='width:30px'/>. It represents the dissipation of energy, the process through which form emerges and light is revealed. This is the zenith of outward expression, where energy reaches its peak before surrendering to entropy.

- **Negotiation** <img src='../Images/bc/yang.png' style='width:30px'/>
In the context of Fire, a yang Negotiation is the buildup of energy that seeks release. Fire does not hesitate; it ignites, consumes, and transforms. Just as a flame must burn to fulfill its purpose, Fire is always in the process of exchanging energy, preparing to radiate outward.

- **Definition** <img src='../Images/bc/yin.png' style='width:30px'/>
A yin definition in the context of Fire signifies the return of yin as yang is released. Fire is defined not by what it holds, but by what it gives away. As energy dissipates, form takes shape, but only for a moment before it, too, is consumed. Like the glow of embers or the fading warmth of a sunset, Fire’s nature is entropy: the dissolution of structure into energy.

- **Contribution** <img src='../Images/bc/yang.png' style='width:30px'/>
In the context of Fire, a yang Contribution is the act of sharing energy with the world. Fire does not keep its power contained; it radiates light, heat, and movement, illuminating everything it touches. Whether as the warmth of the sun, the blaze of a hearth, or the spark of inspiration, Fire’s gift is transformation—giving all of itself so that something new may arise.

### Here are the explanations of the transitional or dynamic interactions.

### ***Release*** <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b06.png' style='width:60px'/> 6  (AIR <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b07.png' style='width:30px'/><img src='../Images/e_wind.png' style='width:30px'/> & FIRE <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b05.png' style='width:30px'/><img src='../Images/e_fire.png' style='width:30px'/>)

*Release* represents accumulated energy that seeks balance. In the process of balancing itself, it dissipates both itself and its recipient, leading to transformation. It is the initial outward movement that leads to expression. Instances of this include **lightning**, the **Big Bang**, and **inspiration**.

The trigram shows the symbol of yin energy re-entering solid yang. A new yin line appears in the lowest position, representing beginning, birth, and idea. The middle line remains yang, showing that yang is still dominant in this phase. Because of this, the transition remains yang in nature, signifying a dynamic release of energy.

The quadrant of *Air* <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b07.png' style='width:30px'/> and *Fire* <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b05.png' style='width:30px'/> is one of outward-descending movement, or external yang. Here, yang has reached the limits of sustainability and must move in the opposite direction. When extreme yang mixes with yin, there is a powerful release of energy, resulting in Fire. This quadrant is outward because creation is a process where energy (yang) takes form (yin), and form exists in the outer world. It is descending because yang expands, and in doing so, it also dissipates itself.

1.  **Negotiation** <img src='../Images/bc/yin.png' style='width:30px'/>
When yang energy reaches completion, it has nowhere left to go—it must interact with yin. At this point, yang becomes dependent on yin for its continued existence, marking a shift where yang is subservient to yin. Just as a storm builds until it has no choice but to discharge lightning, the balance between forces now dictates the outcome.
2.  **Definition** <img src='../Images/bc/yang.png' style='width:30px'/>
When yang meets yin, it seeks immediate release, pushing against the boundaries imposed by yin. This pressure defines the moment of transition, where energy moves into form but does so explosively. The moment before a star ignites or an idea is expressed is the tension of yang pushing against its limits, eager to break free.
3.  **Contribution** <img src='../Images/bc/yang.png' style='width:30px'/>
The expression of yang manifests as Fire, consuming the yin as it releases its energy. This is the moment of illumination, ignition, and transformation—where what was once stored potential becomes a force of action. Whether in the form of a burning flame, a flash of inspiration, or the explosive power of creation, Fire is the visible result of release.

### ***Emptying*** <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b04.png' style='width:60px'/> 4 (FIRE <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b05.png' style='width:30px'/><img src='../Images/e_fire.png' style='width:30px'/> & EARTH <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b00.png' style='width:30px'/><img src='../Images/e_earth.png' style='width:30px'/>) 

*Emptying* represents the dissipation and movement of energy through matter. It is the process that brings order out of chaos, the final outward deflation that returns energy to its primordial state, completing the cycle of creation. Instances of this include **music**, the creation of the **elements**, and **death**.

The trigram shows yin energy overtaking the center, making this trigram yin in nature. Emptying is one of the three trigrams that serve as an originating source, meaning it is fundamental to the cycle of transformation.

The quadrant of *Fire* <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b05.png' style='width:30px'/> and *Earth* <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b00.png' style='width:30px'/> represents final descension, or external yin, where the energy of Fire dissipates and transforms into Earth. This quadrant is external because Fire transitions into Earth, moving from pure energy into structure. It is descending because the energy of creation wanes and stabilizes, shifting from the active state of Fire to the structured state of Earth. This is the process that converts energy into mass (*m=E/c^2*), where the dissolution of Fire gives rise to the solid reality of Earth.

*Historical footnote: m=E/c^2^, not E=mc^2^, was the original formula that Einstein introduced.  It later became  E=mc^2^ for convenience sake.*

1. **Negotiation** <img src='../Images/bc/yin.png' style='width:30px'/>
In the dynamic between Fire and Earth, Fire is always dependent on Earth for expression. Energy alone has no form—it requires a medium through which it can be observed and experienced. Just as flames must consume fuel, Fire can only act within the structure provided by Earth.

- **Definition** <img src='../Images/bc/yin.png' style='width:30px'/>
Fire finds its limits and boundaries in Earth, just as energy is only measurable through matter. Without Earth, Fire would burn without definition, unable to take shape. The constraints of Earth determine the expression of Fire, just as the properties of physical matter determine how energy manifests in the world.

- **Contribution** <img src='../Images/bc/yang.png' style='width:30px'/>
The restructuring of matter by energy is what brings everything into existence. Fire reshapes and transforms Earth, creating new patterns, forms, and structures. Whether in the fusion of elements in a star, the creative process of music, or the transformation of life into death and renewal, emptying is the action that finalizes creation by dissolving energy into structure.

### ***Filling*** <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b01.png' style='width:60px'/> 1 (EARTH <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b00.png' style='width:30px'/><img src='../Images/e_earth.png' style='width:30px'/>& WATER <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b01.png' style='width:30px'/><img src='../Images/e_water.png' style='width:30px'/>)

*Filling* represents form coming to life. It is the initial inward inflation of a new cycle, the moment when energy begins to enter and shape an empty vessel. Instances of this include **gestation**, **dark matter** (expansion of the universe), and **artificial intelligence**.

The trigram shows the return of yang energy in the lowest position, signifying the first movement toward manifestation. However, the center remains yin, meaning the process is still within the domain of receptivity rather than full expression. Filling is one of the three trigrams that serve as an originating source, representing the first influx of energy that initiates formation.

The quadrant of *Earth* <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b00.png' style='width:30px'/> and *Water* <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b01.png' style='width:30px'/> represents new beginnings, or internal yin, where the emptiness of Earth begins to receive energy and return to life. It is inward because yang enters from the lowest position and ascending because yang continues to rise, gradually shaping what was once formless.

1.  **Negotiation** <img src='../Images/bc/yang.png' style='width:30px'/>
In the context of Filling, a yang Negotiation arises because the absence of yang naturally draws it inward. Just as a vacuum pulls in air, or an empty vessel invites substance, the void within Earth seeks to be filled. The process begins not through force, but through attraction, as yang enters to restore balance.
2.  **Definition** <img src='../Images/bc/yin.png' style='width:30px'/>
A yin Definition in the context of Filling signifies that yang must first shape the empty yin vessel before it can express itself. Before light can shine, it must have a source; before a seed can grow, it must find soil. Yang is present, but its form is determined by the structure and capacity of Earth to hold and shape it.
3.  **Contribution** <img src='../Images/bc/yin.png' style='width:30px'/>
In the context of Filling, a yin Contribution represents the universal availability of yang energy, which can be accessed from anywhere. Just as Earth serves as an electrical ground for all circuits, the presence of a stable, receptive state allows energy to be drawn upon when needed. Filling does not create energy—it opens the space for energy to flow, forming the foundation for all future manifestations.

### ***Collecting*** <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b03.png' style='width:60px'/> 3 (WATER <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b01.png' style='width:30px'/><img src='../Images/e_water.png' style='width:30px'/> & AIR <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b07.png' style='width:30px'/><img src='../Images/e_wind.png' style='width:30px'/>)

*Collecting* represents the higher orders of structure that extend ever outward. It is the final internal inflation, the stage of completion and preparation before outward expression. Instances of this include the **Internet**, **space-born viruses**, and the **Mongol Empire**, each representing a system that has expanded and gathered momentum before dispersing its influence.

This trigram, with two emerging yang lines, signifies a shift into the domain of yang. The structure is still forming, but the final transition toward full yang dominance is approaching.

The quadrant of *Water* <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b01.png' style='width:30px'/> and *Air* <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b07.png' style='width:30px'/> represents preparation, or internal yang, where the balanced state of Water ascends and expands into the polar state of Air. This is the moment when gathered energy reaches its peak before transitioning into outward expansion.

1. **Negotiation** <img src='../Images/bc/yang.png' style='width:30px'/>
In the context of Collecting, a yang Negotiation marks the shift toward dominance, as yang begins to outnumber and overtake the remaining yin. This is the turning point where structure is no longer being shaped by constraints but begins to establish its own rules. Like a movement gaining critical mass, this is the moment when preparation nears completion and momentum becomes self-sustaining.

- **Definition** <img src='../Images/bc/yang.png' style='width:30px'/>
A yang definition in the context of collecting signifies the culmination of expression. No longer bound by the limitations of Earth, yang is free to expand into the boundless domain of Air. This is the ultimate phase of growth, where an instance reaches its fullest potential, whether as an empire at its height, a network reaching global scale, or an idea expanding beyond its creator.

- **Contribution** <img src='../Images/bc/yin.png' style='width:30px'/>
In the context of Collecting, a yin Contribution represents what remains after the peak of expansion has passed. The influence of a system, idea, or creation persists beyond its initial expression, leaving a legacy only time can reveal. Like the ripples left by a great movement or the data of the past embedded in the present, Collecting ensures that something endures beyond the moment of expansion itself.

## Pi Generation from Tholonic Principles

<img src='../Images/times7.png' style='float:right;width:30%'/>Here is the Python3 code to run the Pi generator, which demonstrates the mathematical relationship between tholonic principles and fundamental constants.  The image on the right is the triad that is used as input values.

```python
def compute_tholonic_pi(max_iter=1000000, tol=1e-10):
# Initial conditions based on the Tholonic model diagram
N_k = 1  # Starting value (analogous to N_0 in the diagram)  
h_step = 2  # Increment step for updating sum_d and prod_c in each iteration  
sum_d = 3  # Divisor term d (related to CN = 3 in the diagram)  
prod_c = 5  # Divisor term c (related to ND = 5 in the diagram)

for count in range(max_iter):
# Refinement step: Update N_k based on division and summation rules
N_next = N_k - (1 / sum_d) + (1 / prod_c)

# Print progress every 1000 iterations to reduce I/O overhead
if count % 1000 == 0:
print(f"Iteration {count}: π approximation = {N_next * 4}")

# Check if the approximation is close enough to π
if abs(N_next * 4 - 3.141592653589793) < tol:
print(f"Converged at iteration {count}: π ≈ {N_next * 4}")
return N_next * 4  # Return the computed approximation of π

# Update values for the next iteration
N_k = N_next  # Set new N_k for the next step
sum_d += h_step ** 2  # Increment sum_d (analogous to adding h²)
prod_c += h_step * 2  # Increment prod_c (analogous to adding 2h)

# If max iterations are reached without convergence
print("Max iterations reached. Approximate π:", N_k * 4)
return N_k * 4

# Run the optimized function
compute_tholonic_pi()
```

This program demonstrates how π can be derived through the tholonic relationships discovered in our analysis of the I Ching. The initial values are taken from the tholonic interpretation of trigrams, particularly the relationships between Negotiation, Definition, and Contribution as mapped to the primary trigram values.

# The 8×8 Grid

Before we go down this seemingly obscure rabbit hole, the reader might be interested in why we are even bothering with this. As in each, as this sounds, this old potentially profound information, especially in the world of physics and energy.

As was mentioned earlier, 2×3=6 is the simplest instance of the most fundamental pattern of interaction. And we saw examples of this at the beginning of this introduction in the form of *F=ma, V=IR, W=Fd, c=f\λ, E=hf, v = λ\f, and even E=mc².* These are just a few of hundreds of instances that we can see across all Sciences, physics, and even metaphysics.

When we say 2×3, we are describing a function that has two dimensions: 2 and 3, just as saying “1” alone has only one dimension. Likewise, if we say 3×3×2, we are describing something three-dimensional. 2D formulas are very common in physics and mechanics, as well as electricity, as we demonstrated earlier, but 2×3 is the archetype of that pattern. What would the archetype of a 3D function look like? The most likely candidate is 2×2×3, but the Tholonic model and the I Ching suggest that 3×3×2 is more accurate because 3×3×2 is actually more self-similar than 2×2×3. Here is why, as explained by AI[^13], which does a far better job of explaining than I do:

[^13]: OpenAI, ChatGPT 4.0

##### The 3×3×2 structure is more self-similar than the 2×2×3 structure because it maintains greater uniformity across its dimensions. In a 3×3×2 configuration, the two larger dimensions (3×3) form a square base, which exhibits a repeating pattern, while the smaller third dimension (2) allows for a balanced extension. This preserves a sense of proportionality and symmetry, making it more conducive to recursive self-similarity. In contrast, a 2×2×3 structure lacks this symmetry, as its dominant 3-length dimension disrupts the uniformity between its two smaller, equal sides. Self-similarity often arises from balanced repetition across dimensions, making 3×3×2 a more structurally consistent and recursively extendable form.



In this 3D extended version of the 2D of fundamental interaction we see that *18=2×3^2^* is a much closer archetype to *E=mc^2^*, as well as *KE=$\frac{1}{2}$mv^2^* (kinetic energy), *P=(σAT^2^)×T^2^* (radiant power), *kq=Er^2^* (electric field), *P/4πr^2^* (radiant intensity), and more.

We see a pattern that equates the speed of light (c) with 3 and mass with 2. Mapped to the tholon, where 2 equates to *Limitation/Definition* and 3 equates to *Contribution/Integration*, we gain an expanded understanding of what E might represent. This becomes even more profound when we apply the concept of the I Ching, where 2 equates not only to the limits of our environment but also to the laws of reality.

I think we can all agree that mass is an excellent example of the limitation of energy, given that mass is essentially energy "slowed down" by *8.987×10^16^m^2^/s^2^*, and it unquestionably limits the existence of everything.

In the Tholonic spectrum of Awareness and Intention, 2 equates with Awareness, as awareness itself is a defining process, an act of definition or limitation.

This then equates 3 with Intention, suggesting that movement is the contributing and integrating quality, and given that the potential of movement is, by definition, energy, and the very purpose of radiation (light) is to distribute energy, we can say that the intentions of energy are to distribute itself. The tholonic claim is that energy only exists as a result of the balancing of some imbalance, which suggests that the “intention” of energy is to achieve balance.

With all the above in mind, the formula *E=mc^2*^ can be seen as stating that:

- Awareness (mass) becomes Energy through the recursive amplification of Intention (light speed squared).
- Awareness stabilizes energy, while Intention releases and distributes it.
- Energy itself, therefore, is both the defined potential and the dynamic expression of that potential.

As for the grid itself and the number within it, this 8×8 grid emerged from this *2×3^2* pattern. We began by splitting 18 into two prime numbers: 7 and 11, which provide a balanced representation from both tholonic and I Ching perspectives. We then further divided 11 into two complementary pairs: 5+6 and 4+7, seeking the most even distributions possible. These numbers, 0 through 7, were then positioned within an 8×8 grid following a pattern where complementary pairs always sum to 7 (0+7, 1+6, 2+5, 3+4). The red numbers (0, 1, 2, 3) occupy positions in the left/upper portion of the grid, while their green complements (7, 6, 5, 4) are positioned in the right/lower portion, creating a visual representation of balance. The exact locations of these numbers are determined by the relationship between the polar chart (which appears to be the parent tholon) and the binary chart (which appears to be a child tholon). This arrangement reflects fundamental principles found in both the Tholonic Model and the I Ching, where opposing yet complementary forces interact to create wholeness. The grid thus represents a two-dimensional manifestation of how the original number 18 can be decomposed into balanced, interrelated elements that maintain specific mathematical relationships while embodying principles of negotiation, limitation, and contribution.

The placement of these numbers and the numbers themselves, in the 8×8 grid emerged from our systematic decomposition of the original number 18 derived from the archetypal pattern of *2×3^2^*. We first split 18 into two prime numbers (7 and 11), then further divided 11 into complementary pairs, ultimately giving us the set of numbers 0 through 7 to place in our grid.

If one wanted to apply this concept to their own personal instances of awareness and intention, a very simple starting point would be something along the lines of the following:

- **Meditative Focus**: Sit in a comfortable, grounded position and bring your awareness to a single point (like your breath or a word).
- **Intention Setting**: With every inhale, acknowledge your awareness. With every exhale, project your intention outward, imagining it magnifying with each breath.
- **Recursive Visualization**: Imagine your intention looping back on itself, becoming stronger and more amplified with each cycle.
- **Affirmation**: "My awareness stabilizes my being, and my intention amplifies my purpose."

### **From 2×3^2^ to an 8×8 Grid**
As briefly as possible, here is the relationship between 2×3² and our 8×8 grid.

2²×3=12 divides into balanced 6+6 and further into 3+3, creating perfect symmetry. 12 divides by 3, giving 4, then by 2, reinforcing balance. No two primes sum to 12 or 6.

Conversely, 2×3² divides by 2 and 3 but also equals prime pairs 5+13, 7+11, 17+1. The most balanced is 7+11. The two most balanced distributions of 11 are 6+5 and 7+4.

This contrast shows 2²×3 produces balanced even numbers while 3²×2 creates imbalanced prime structures, but also suggests that the more balanced and symmetrical patterns precede the dynamic patterns, which we also see in the patterns of the **DESCENDING** and ***Ascending***, suggesting **DESCENDING** precedes ***Ascending***.

Our 8×8 grid shows pairs summing to 7. The set containing the number that form two 11s, which were arrived at by reconstructing 11 as evenly as possible, and 11 was arrived at by deconstructing 18 into its prime numbers as evenly as possible. If we have the set {{6,5},{7,4}}, then we implicitly have the complementary set of {{1,2},{0,3}} necessary to have sums that pair to 7. This makes the {{6,5},{7,4}} set the explicit or defining set, and {{1,2},{0,3}} the implicit or contributing set, as its complement.

Referring back to the polar chart, we notice the order of cardinal pairs differs between their sequential binary values and their positions on the polar star-chart (starting from the top and rotating clockwise). This is because the cardinal polar pairs define the "cardinal" themes, while the 32 paths or pairs define archetypes that can play out in those themes in either an ascending or descending fashion. Hierarchically speaking, the 32 pairs are expressed within the cardinal themes; the cardinal themes are tholons, and the 32 pairs are partons. However, they are also tholons as well, each with two partons of ascending and descending hexagrams, which are tholons that include two partons of trigrams, which are tholons that include three partons of lines, which form a fundamental or primary tholon.

This 8×8 grid shows several interesting relationships between the ascending and descending principles.

You can understand how this 8×8 chart was arrived at by looking at the two lists of cardinal hexagrams below. The list on the left is the first 8 pairs in sequential binary order or the order of the 32 pairs, and the list on the right is in the order of the 8 cardinal points on the polar chart, out of the 64 points in total. Each line is assigned the number of its position, and as each position has an ascending (green) and descending (red) property, each position has two entries. The items are numbered 0–7. The matching descending items are then connected (left image).

<center><img src='../Images/pol-seq-xover.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

We can see the connecting pattern for descending hexagrams is perfectly symmetrical, but when we do the same for the ascending hexagrams, it looks radically different. Although not symmetrical, it's still a clear pattern, but a very dynamic one, with two diagonal lines moving up and down inside two parallel lines. Here again we see the duality of structure and order in the domain of the descending, and that of movement in the domain of the ascending.

However, its true pattern becomes clear when we plot these relationships, as you will soon see.

We end up with the following connecting pairs of descending hexagrams: (0, 0), (1, 4), (2, 2), (3, 6), (4, 1), (5, 5), (6, 3), (7, 7), which are then plotted as shown above and in the image below (left).

When we connect the ascending pairs (right image), we get: (0, 0), (1, 4), (2, 6), (3, 2), (4, 7), (5, 3), (6, 5), (7, 1).

The two 8×8 plots are shown below

<center><img src='../Images/polar-binary.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

There are several fantastic patterns to explore; for example:

<img src='../Images/ad-quark.png' style='float:right;width:15%'/>The change that needs to occur to transform the ascending (left) to the descending (right) is: [1] down 3, [2] down 1, [3] up 1, [5] down 1, [6] up 1, [7] up 3.  [0] and [4] do not change.

The first thing that comes to mind is this is the exact same “pattern” that we see in how quarks form protons and neutrons, because the proton is composed of two *up* quarks and one *down* quark, while the neutron is composed of one *up* quark and two *down* quarks. This correlation tells us that the ascending hexagrams {4,5,6,7} share this property with the imbalanced positively charged proton, and the descending hexagrams {0,1,2,3} share this property with the balanced neutrally charged neutron. Additionally, given that *up* quarks have a charge of +1/3 and *down* quarks have a charge of -1/3, if we apply these values to each *up* or *down* movement, we end up with all the total down movements = 1 and all the total up movements = 1.

Another truly mind-blowing observation (for me, at least) is not only the fractal nature of numbers, but the emergence of perfectly integrated structures composed of static and dynamic patterns that naturally evolve simply by examining the various perspectives that a larger multidimensional structure naturally presents when projected onto two dimensions. We see a perfectly ordered pattern in the Ascending Hexagrams 8×8 plot, but a seemingly disordered pattern in the Descending Hexagrams plot. However, when we combine them, a new pattern emerges

Even more astonishing is that when we combine these similar patterns, we get another fascinating pattern that seems to reference the 10 pairs of stable hexagrams and the 22 pairs of dynamic hexagrams. Furthermore, we observe a triad with the exact same color mapping as a tholon, where yellow 4 represents the child *Negotiated* N-state (which is always the opposite of its parent, represented by the blue N-state), the green 7 as *Limitation/Definition*, and the red 1 as *Contribution/Integration*. This suggests that 7 is the limiting or defining concept, which would certainly be true in an octal system, which we are using, where any single digit cannot exceed 7. This is why the maximum value of the hexagrams is 77, which equated to 63.

This would make 1 the contributing concept, which is quite intuitive considering that 1 is the fundamental unit, the concept of unification, the source of emergence, and primordial in that it is fundamentally indivisible and necessary for any numerical formation.

<img src='../Images/10-22.png' style='float:right;width:25%'/>This triad also forms two number pyramids: the central and larger pyramid starts with {4} → {3, 4, 5} → {2, 3, 4, 5, 6} → {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}, and the smaller pyramid that emerges from 0 starts with {1} → {1, 2} → {1, 2, 3} → {1, 2, 3, 4}. We know this because all the numbers in both number pyramids perfectly align with the grid numbers.

If we represent the sum of each row as octals, we get 4 + 14 + 24 + 34 = 100 (which equals 64 in decimal), and this only happens if we start with 4. This is remarkable because the total number of hexagrams in octal is 100 (which equals 64 in decimal)!

On the {4, 7} vector, we have a "scope" of 11 (4 + 7) spread out over a negative range of -3 (4 - 7). Across that spectrum of -3, there exist two 11s, or 2 × the value of the scope, making the value of the entire line 11 + (11 + 11)

On the {4, 1} vector, there is also a scope of 5 (4 + 1) spread out over a positive range of +3 (4 - 1). Across that spectrum of +3, there exist two 5s, or 2 × the value of the scope, also spread out over 3 (4 - 1), making the value of the entire line 5 + (5 + 5).

This establishes a clear pattern for the vector values, with ‘5’ for the left vector and ‘11’ for the right vector, and the vectors themselves divided into three parts. Naturally, 11 + 5 = 16, which matches the number of original hexagrams needed to create the 64 hexagrams.

If we apply the positive and negative values to the equations, we have: +11(-11 - 11) for the right vector and +5(+5 + 5) for the left vector, resulting in -11 + 15 = 4.

Given that of the 32 pairs of hexagrams, the 10 balanced pairs fall on the {4,1} vector, while the 22 imbalanced or dynamic pairs fall on the {4,7} vector, these two vectors can be described as:

<img src='../Images/left-right.png' style='width:80%'/>

In any case, this is a fascinating example of symmetry, self-similarity, and harmonic balance.

Of course, all these amazing patterns and relationships are simply the effect of deterministic mathematics, and there is nothing "special" about them. However, from the Tholonic perspective, this only confirms the idea that such patterns are found in all creations across all scopes and contexts, which is really what we are interested in. What is “special” is how these patterns support the model of the tholonic I Ching, which is most evident in the only two positions that do not change, the [0] and [4], which are the extreme top and bottom points of 2䷁*~0~* ***Receptive*** ⇔ 1䷀*~63~* **CREATIVE** and 24䷗*~1~* ***Return*** ⇔ 44䷫*~62~* **COMING TO MEET** that define the entire spectrum and the vertical axis. Not only can we map these two sets of four points to a tetrahedron, they can be perfectly mapped to a parent and child tholon and even the two trigrams and six lines of the hexagrams where NDC properties and the I Ching archetypes align perfectly.
