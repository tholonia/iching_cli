## Tholonic Patterns of Creation and Transformation


The I Ching, according to the Tholonic model, has two “directions”: ascending and descending. The ascending direction consists of the first 32 binary values, while the descending direction consists of the following 32 binary values.

In the Tholonic model, the natural order of change follows this progression: Low-entropy chaos → order and complexity → high-entropy chaos.

A good example of this pattern is the progression of the universe from the Big Bang to its ultimate fate. The universe begins in a state of low-entropy chaos (the Big Bang), expands and develops increasing order and complexity, and eventually declines into high-entropy chaos, such as Heat Death, the Big Freeze, the Big Rip, Vacuum Decay, the Black Hole Era, and Hawking Radiation Evaporation, as all structure dissipates, according to these theories.

A good example of this pattern is the progression of the universe from the Big Bang to its ultimate fate. The universe begins in a state of low-entropy chaos (the Big Bang), expands and develops increasing order and complexity, and eventually declines into high-entropy chaos, such as Heat Death, the Big Freeze, the Big Rip, Vacuum Decay, the Black Hole Era, and Hawking Radiation Evaporation, as all structure dissipates, according to these theories.

As a reminder, the ascending side of the I Ching is where we move from the ultimate Yin state, [*2䷁~0~ **Receptive***], to the maximum Yang state that can exist in the Yin domain, [*43䷪~31~ **Breakthrough***]. The descending side begins as [23䷖~32~ **Splitting Apart**], the maximum Yin state that can exist in the Yang domain, and continues to the ultimate Yang state of [1䷀~63~ **The Creative**].

This model indicates that ䷁ and ䷀ are the two states of maximum chaos, the Yin chaos of maximum entropy and the Yang chaos of minimum entropy. It may seem odd to associate Yin with low entropy and Yang with high entropy, but the reasoning is as follows:

Receptivity (䷁) is the most compatible with low entropy because it represents a state of maximum potential, where energy remains unstructured and available for directed transformation. Like a vacuum that can accommodate limitless expansion, an all-Yin system has no imposed direction or movement, meaning it holds the greatest capacity for ordered, purposeful development. Since low entropy corresponds to a system where energy is highly concentrated and has not yet been dispersed, receptivity aligns perfectly with this principle, as it provides the ideal environment for structured emergence without yet engaging in full expression.

Creation (䷀) is the most compatible with high entropy because it represents the full expression and expansion of energy into its maximum form. With all lines being Yang, there is no room left for additional directed movement, meaning the system has reached its most fully realized, high-entropy state. In this sense, creation aligns with high entropy because energy has been fully utilized and distributed, leaving no latent potential for further directed transformation. Like a star that has burned through its fuel, creation signifies a state where all available energy has been expressed, requiring a return to receptivity for renewal.

This diagram shows the order of pairs and the entire sequence (the 10 red pairs of hexagrams have a balance of three Yin and three Yang)


<center><img src='../Images/0_008.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

This seems to suggest that the ultimate end of the Universe is represented by [1䷀~63~ **Creative**], which seems contrary to reason, but here is the reasoning that supports this idea.

The [1䷀~63~ **Creative**] is the universe at its most complete, the culmination of all possible expression. It is the final state in which energy has been fully structured, fully realized, and fully spent. Nothing more can be created because everything that could exist has already emerged. All differentiation, all movement, all transformation has reached its peak, leaving no further possibilities for change. In this moment, the universe is absolute, total, and without remainder, a condition so complete that nothing new can enter, nothing old can be undone. It is a moment of pure finality, where all that has been set into motion has played out its course, and what remains is a universe that has nothing left to become.

In the Tholonic model, the paradox of "Creation = Destruction" arises from the fundamental nature of Yang energy, which inherently expands, transforms, and consumes. Yang is the creative, active, and dynamic force, but by its very nature, it drives toward maximum entropy—the ultimate dissipation and dissolution of structure and energy. This is why fire, as a metaphor for creative energy, results in ash—it burns brightly and transforms its fuel into residual matter, leaving behind entropy and emptiness.

In the cosmic sense, Yang-driven processes lead to high-entropy end states, such as heat death, the big freeze, vacuum decay, or black hole evaporation. These scenarios reflect Yang energy pushing the universe toward the ultimate dispersal of order and structure. Thus, the beginning of creation inherently contains the seed of its own dissolution—the very act of creating and manifesting eventually consumes the energy that sustains it.

The resolution to this paradox lies in the interplay between Yang and Yin. While Yang initiates and expands, Yin conserves, preserves, and regenerates. The destruction of one creation gives rise to potential new forms, much like ashes enriching the soil for new growth. In this sense, destruction is not the antithesis of creation but its inevitable counterpart, completing the cycle where creation transforms into dissolution, and dissolution becomes the fertile ground for new creation.

Therefore, Creation and Destruction are not opposites but aspects of a single continuous process—the eternal cycle of transformation, where fire becomes ash, and ash nurtures new life. The creative force both initiates and concludes, embodying the dynamic balance between expansion and entropy.

When all has been fully realized, there is no longer movement, and when movement ceases, the conditions for a new cycle arise. The Creative, in exhausting itself, returns to [*2䷁~0~ **Receptive***], not as a separate phase, but as the inevitable consequence of total expression. The universe at its most complete is indistinguishable from the universe before it was born. The final expression is not merely an end; it is a return to the pure potential from which everything emerges.

Thus, the greatest fullness and the greatest emptiness are the same. The ultimate creation and the formless void are not opposites, but two ways of perceiving a singular reality, just as a zero dimensional point and a point of infinite dimensions are indistinguishable from each other. One is the last moment before dissolution, the other is the first moment before formation, but thermodynamically, they are identical, as potential for change is zero in both cases. What we call an ending is nothing but the stillness before a new beginning, and what we call a beginning is only the next emergence of movement from that stillness. The Creative, having fully expressed itself, does not collapse into nothingness, it *becomes nothingness*, and in doing so, it prepares for creation once more.

Lao Tzu not only alludes to this duality of oneness when describing the nature of the Tao, but is quite clear that the end of one begets the other, alternating in sequence, each being the cause and the effect of the other.

> ##### As soon as beauty is known by the world as beautiful, it becomes ugly. *As soon as virtue is being known as something good, it becomes evil.* *Therefore being and non-being give birth to each other.* *Difficult and easy accomplish each other.* *Long and short form each other.* *High and low distinguish each other.* *Sound and tone harmonize each other.* *Before and after follow each other as a sequence.* \~ Lao Tzu,Tao Te Ching

We can see a similar pattern in the evolution of the lines if we apply the six stages of growth to the previous model of all the lines in all 64 hexagrams.

## The Waters


Doesn't the final stage of a perfect hexagonal array conflict with the final stage of the chaos at the end of the Universe? Ironically, no. In fact, the honeycomb is a perfect analog or metaphor for the final "death" of the universe.

The apparent conflict arises from misinterpreting what the final stage represents. The perfect hexagonal array and the end state of the universe are not opposites but different scopes of the same fundamental principle: the perfect dissipation of energy. In both contexts, they represent the culmination of creative processes, where energy is distributed so uniformly and efficiently that no further transformation is possible.

Though the hexagonal array appears perfectly ordered, it also represents a state of maximal entropy—where no gradients remain, and thus, no transformation can occur. In the material world, the hexagonal structure (like a honeycomb or crystalline lattice) perfectly dissipates pressure and energy, achieving maximum stability and equilibrium. This formation arises because energy naturally seeks the most efficient, balanced state, which in three dimensions results in hexagonal tessellation. The uniformity and coherence of the hexagon embody perfect structural harmony—no force or energy is left unaccounted for, and all stress is evenly shared among interconnected units.

Interestingly, water itself exemplifies this principle, both in its molecular structure and in its behavior. In its liquid form, water molecules arrange themselves in transient, ever-shifting tetrahedral networks. This dynamic structure allows for the efficient dissipation of energy through the fluid medium, constantly adapting to external forces and redistributing kinetic energy evenly. When water transitions into ice, it forms hexagonal crystalline lattices, such as in snowflakes or ice crystals. These hexagonal patterns are the natural consequence of water's tetrahedral bonding, optimizing structural stability and minimizing energy gradients. This ability to shift between chaotic flow and ordered stability while always seeking energy equilibrium makes water not only the perfect metaphor for the end state of the universe but also a symbolic representation of the cyclical transformation between chaos and order.

On a cosmic scale, the end state of the universe—whether it be heat death, vacuum decay, or the Big Freeze—represents maximum entropy and energy dissipation. Just as the hexagon disperses internal pressure evenly, the final state of existence disperses energy so uniformly that no further change can occur. The universe reaches a state of perfect equilibrium, where all potential for transformation has been exhausted.

Thus, the honeycomb pattern, hexagonal ice crystals, and the ultimate cosmic dissipation are identical in principle but differ in scope and context. The honeycomb and ice both act as material metaphors for the universe's final state because they represent the culmination of dynamic processes into a perfectly stable, energy-dissipative structure. In both cases, creation reaches its ultimate expression by achieving a state of perfect order and balance, whether in the microcosm of a honeycomb, the crystalline lattice of ice, or the macrocosm of the universe itself.

In this way, the final hexagonal state does not oppose chaos but completes it. The cycle closes with a perfect stillness that echoes its chaotic beginning, but in reverse—a mirror of order. Just as water existed before creation in ancient mythologies—calm and undifferentiated—the end state of the universe returns to that primal stillness, the waters of potential within which all new creation will arise.

This concepts is mirrored in the Torah and Bible’s Old Testament in Genesis:

**Genesis 1:1–2 (KJV):**

1. *In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.*
2. *And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.*

Here, we can see that the *waters* existed before God created anything, and, coincidentally, as God was creating the stars, moon, sun, sky earth and all living creatures, God never created water, presumable because it already existed.

We see a similar theme with *the waters* in the Babylonian, Egyptian, Hindu, Greek, Norse, Polynesian, Native American, and  Aztec create stories.

Not surprisingly, the Biblical Hebrew for “Waters” is **מַּיִם** (mayim) can mean many things, such as “primordial chaos”, “life”, “divine sustenance”, “purification”, “divine intention”, “a moving force”.  the phrase “*God moved upon the face of the waters*”  is similar to how we might say in English “*She set the table by the window.*”, which can mean:

- She arranged dishes and cutlery on the table located by the window.
- She placed the entire table near the window.
- She fixed the table near the window (e.g., attached it or made it stable).
- She decided the location for the meeting to be by the window.
- She adjusted the settings on a device (like a smart table) to show a display by the window.

In the Tholonic model, the *primordial waters* is seen as the pre-manifest awareness field, the undifferentiated potential that bifurcates into **Negotiation**, **Definition**, and **Contribution**. Just as awareness itself becomes differentiated through intention, the *waters of the void* are activated by Intention to begin creation.

The final dissipation of energy, like the honeycomb or crystalline ice, represents returning to the *waters*, the latent awareness field from which new creation can arise. This cyclic perspective mirrors how chaos begets order, and order eventually returns to chaos,  both states intrinsically linked to the *waters of potential*.

For this reason, and because of actual studies and research that have been performed, the Tholonic model sees water as the most efficient transmission medium for Tholonic energy.





## Just a Touch of Chaos


The following is a bit of a tangent, but worth sharing before we continue with the lines. Below is a graphic that shows three conditions of the descending pattern of chaos→order. The first condition is *Maximum Freedom*, where the direction of the children is undetermined and completely unlimited. The second condition, *Limited Freedom*, is where the direction of the children is limited by 96% (4% freedom). The final condition, *No Freedom*, is where there can be no deviation from the rule. This is an excellent example of the effect of and necessity for *definition* and *limitation*.


<center><img src='../Images/3stage-freedom.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

The forms used to represent the stages of change are “perfect” archetypes, in that they adhere strictly to a very tight set of rules. In reality, there are many other forces in play other than an isolated set of rules, making it rare, if not impossible, for a perfect archetype to instantiate. In the image above, with just a little bit of chaos, we get forms that are much closer to what we see in the real world. In the images below, we added a little more variation to our perfect process on just two variables, length and angle, resulting in a wider variety of “realistic” forms. The black forms below each variation show the perfect archetype they were based on.

##### Note: The “leaves” of these “plants” were naturally formed by the unfolding of the starboard and port-side arrow heads that indicate the direction of the expanding bifurcations that form the 6 lines of the hexagrams’

## By the Numbers


Let’s run another test to see if the thologram and the I Ching are two views of the same model.

Previously we assigned the positions of the points on the tholon as 1 through 6 in order to work with the positions of the I Ching lines, but while the I Ching order (sequential from top including lines) was 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, the Tholonic order was 0, 5, 1, 3, 2, 4. Here is where the validity of that order is shown.

Now we need to work with the hexagrams and their values, so we need to use the position of the points as the exponential value of 2 (because we’re working in binary), and to do that we need to start counting at 0, not 1. In ***Fig. e1*** (below) you can see the values arrived at for each point, and the exponent used to get that value. ***Fig. e2*** shows the sum of these values for each triad and each side. In ***Fig. e3*** we have added the name and the hexagram. Don’t forget that all these numbers are binary and not the numbers as they appear in the traditional I Ching layout.

<center><img src='../Images/tritest.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

##### <img src='../Images/trialgebra.png' style='float:right;width:20%'/>Note: We identify the lines by grouping together the two points that form that line. This is usually shown with the traditional **overline** symbol (right), however, due to the limitation of the text formatting tools, in written text this will be shown as underlined, for example <u>ND</u> refers to the connecting line, or vector, between N and D).

The values of the lines are determined by the sum of the points that define the lines. For example, the **DC** vector above contains the values 2^1^, 2^3^, 2^2^ or 2, 8, 4 which, when summed, equals 14, which is the value of the line. The value of the triads is similarly determined by adding the values of their defining points. For example, the top triad has the points 2^0^, 2^5^, 2^4^ or 1, 32, 16 which equals 49.

Here are some observations from the above:

-   The sum of any triad and the side opposite that triad always equal 63, the maximum number possible. This was exciting to discover as it supports the Tholonic claim that the effect of any point can be seen on the side opposite that point.  In our example above, we see the side [41䷨~35~ **Decrease**] plus the opposing corner of [*31䷞~28~ **Influence***] equals 35 + 28 = 63.  What this means is that the triad and the opposing vector are the same path name!  This then also tells us that the only 3 paths involved are: *Growth*, *Refinement*, and *Perfection*, with the center path, which is singularity as it has no manifest children, is *Equilibrium*.  More that that, we are being told that Growth itself the stable *N-State*, and it instantiates as the **Limitation** of *Perfection*, and the contribution of *Refinement*, and from these two instances, we create  *Equilibrium*.
-   What is most interesting about this pattern, assuming this is not just an extremely rare and almost impossible coincidence that it perfectly portrays the qualities of growth, is that *Perfection* is presented as the *Limitation*. This is fascinating because perfection itself is perhaps the most limiting concept of all, given that it can never truly be achieved. Yet, the effort to achieve it, represented by *Refinement*, becomes the **Contribution**. In this way, *Growth* emerges not from reaching perfection but from the process of continuous improvement in a vain attempt to reach the impossible, highlighting how the pursuit itself generates the stable state rather than the attainment of an unattainable ideal.
    
-   Every number our example (14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56), including their sums (63, 70), is a multiple of 7 (times 2 to 10), suggesting the the resulting *white dot* = 7
    
-   Every hexagram derived from these Tholonic values has an equal number of Yin and Yang lines (only 10 of the 32 pairs of hexagrams in the I Ching have an equal number of Yin and Yang), telling us these are balanced, stable archetypes.
    
-   Only the value of the top triad is odd when the other triads are even, and even when the other triads are odd.
- If we add all the values together (14+7+21+35) we get decimal value of 77… which is also the octal value of 63!

There are many more patterns and relationships as well, and this is only within one tholon that has no parents or children!



## A Note on Form and Function


Given that every number has a patterned relationship with one or more numbers, we can theoretically reverse engineer where every I Ching hexagram sits within the thologram, assigning a unique binary value to every vector (or point, though here we're focusing on vectors). According to the Tholonic model, this theoretical framework can extend to everything that exists. Here's a concise explanation of that reasoning.

Consider the example of a relatively simple protein composed of 60 amino acids chosen from the standard set of 20 amino acids. While small compared to some proteins containing up to 2,000 amino acids, the probability of forming this particular protein randomly is roughly 1 in 10⁷⁷. Numerically, this probability approaches the number of atoms in the observable universe (around 10⁸⁰), making its spontaneous appearance improbable without constraints.

The key issue with interpreting evolution solely through randomness is that it neglects inherent constraints. Evolutionary theory itself acknowledges selection pressures and environmental limitations, significantly reducing the combinational space. The Tholonic model explicitly incorporates these constraints into its structure.

To illustrate this point, observe the table below:

<center><img src='../Images/realtholons.png' style='width:70%'/></center>
As generations progress, the potential number of combinations rapidly increases. Starting from an initial triad, stable patterns emerge. From each stable pattern, a new triad can form, producing further stable patterns. However, only stable patterns are viable and capable of propagation. After just 129 generations, the theoretical combinations exceed 10⁷⁷. Critically, at each generation, we only generate a manageable set of new parameters, specifically the pair labeled DC.

Thus, the assumption that nature explores the entire combinational space (10⁷⁷ possibilities) is misleading. Tholonically, the available combinational field at each stage is limited to a few properties, embedded self-similarly within each generation. This approach significantly reduces complexity, explaining how new viable patterns can emerge naturally within constrained circumstances.

To clarify this point further, consider a mathematical analogy involving coin flips:

A Bell curve illustrates 50,000 runs of flipping 32 coins:

Test 1: 32 coins → ~16 heads

Test 2: 16 coins (heads from Test 1) → ~8 heads

Test 3: 8 coins → ~4 heads

Test 4: 4 coins → ~2 heads

Test 5: 2 coins → ~1 head

<img src='../Images/101-toincoss.png' style='float:right;width:40%'/>Running these tests sequentially, you inevitably arrive at one coin, representing a 100% chance, given these specific constraints. However, an observer unaware of these constraints might mistakenly assume only a small chance (e.g., 3.2% if initially there were mixed coin types). Without understanding the process and constraints, the observer perceives high improbability where there is, in fact, certainty.

In reality, evolutionary or creative processes do not record failures explicitly; they proceed through stable successes. From the Tholonic perspective, existence inherently proceeds via stable patterns, forward-engineering new possibilities from successful parent states. If a branch fails, it ceases at its last successful stable pattern, with corrections or adaptations naturally emerging, analogous to replacing faulty coins.

Extending this analogy philosophically, one might suggest that each instance carries an implicit binary lineage record. According to the Tholonic model, each tholon inherently encodes a memory of its ancestral path. While the scientific demonstration of such lineage encoding may remain debated (perhaps resonating conceptually with morphic fields), philosophically this claim is reasonable and aligns with the Tholonic perspective that every instance inherently represents its entire history of successful interactions and stable patterns.

<img src="../Images/102-tpaths.png" style='float:right;width:30%'/>This lineage encoding might be envisioned as analogous to the Fourier series concept, wherein hierarchical circular interactions create precise and complex patterns. Each tholon, thus, can conceptually possess a unique "signature" or "fingerprint," representing its exact location and lineage within a broader spectrum of reality.

More deeply, this “signature” doesn’t merely reflect where the tholon is in the structure—it encodes how it came to be. This mirrors the Tholonic principle that Form and Function are not separate, but dual aspects of a single recursive reality. The Form of a tholon is the current stable pattern; its Function is the process that brought it into being. In the Tholonic view, every instance is a self-encoding unit where the path of generation is inherently embedded within the structure of what exists.

Even if empirical demonstration remains complex or contentious, this remains a philosophically coherent perspective within the Tholonic framework.

If we accept this premise then we must also accept that reality itself is, therefore, the repository of all knowledge, awaiting further exploration and decoding. Just as a Fourier series of simple numerical values can reproduce intricate images, reality might inherently encode every instance’s unique lineage within its intrinsic properties, whether through fields, energy patterns, or yet-undiscovered mechanisms.

## Reconstructing the I Ching


If we rebuild the I Ching from the ground up, integrating elements from the I Ching, the Tholonic model, and Western philosophy, we get something like the following:

##### *Note: As mentioned numerous times before, the interpretations, values and relationships shown here are not intended to be conclusive. While I tried to make them as meaningful as possible, they are more used as examples. There are many ways patterns and relationships can be formed and I am sure a better version than the one presented here can be made. If the reader disagrees with some of the conclusions here then consider that an invitation to improve upon it. That is why this book is open-sourced.*


<center><img src='../Images/tholonic-pakua-desc.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

Here are some points about this model:

The 8 trigrams (this is called the *Pa Kua* in the I Ching) are arranged in their binary, or natural order in pairs. The trigrams advance as opposite pairs of 0-7 <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b00.png' style='width:30px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b07.png' style='width:30px'/>, 1-6 <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b01.png' style='width:30px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b06.png' style='width:30px'/>, 2-5 <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b02.png' style='width:30px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b05.png' style='width:30px'/>, and 3-4 <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b03.png' style='width:30px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b04.png' style='width:30px'/> in the clockwise direction. This means the first 4 trigrams are 0, 1, 2, 3, <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b00.png' style='width:30px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b01.png' style='width:30px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b02.png' style='width:30px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b03.png' style='width:30px'/> and the next 4 trigrams are 7, 6, 5, 4 <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b07.png' style='width:30px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b06.png' style='width:30px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b05.png' style='width:30px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b04.png' style='width:30px'/>. This results in a pattern where all opposing numbers always equal 7, the maximum number that can be represented in binary using three places.

**Ring 7**: There are three divisions per quadrant representing the three stages of Tholonic movement (clockwise): **Negotiation**, **Definition**, and **Contribution**. However, it is more accurate to say there are three *phases* or cycles of movement (clockwise), conceptually similar to how three-phase electricity works. All three phases are present all the time at every point, just at different points in the cycle, and, as they are represented in the triads as being 120° apart, they would presumeably appear in the (archetypal) order of the image below. This also suggests that if **Negotiation** starts at the 4:00 position, then **Definition** starts at the 8:00 position and **Contribution** starts at the 12:00 position, putting **Contribution** as the only property that holds a cardinal position, and the most dominant one at that.


<center><img src='../Images/three_phase_waveform.png' style='width:60%'/></center>

**Ring 9**: The two major axes are represented by the four cardinal points. The vertical axis is represented by the most extreme trigrams (7<img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b07.png' style='width:30px'/>, 0<img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b00.png' style='width:30px'/>) for the “north” and the “south,” and the horizontal axis by the most balanced trigrams (5<img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b05.png' style='width:30px'/>, 2<img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b02.png' style='width:30px'/>) for the “east” and “west.”

**Ring 1**: The remaining 4 trigrams (1, 3, 4, 6 in ring 1) are the most imbalanced and are therefore more unstable/dynamic.

The vertical and horizontal axis *reflects*, and the horizontal axis *reflects* as well as *reverses* (like a photo negative). Hence, the lines in the east are a mirror of the lines in the west. This is also true for the lines in the north and the south, but in addition, they are also reversed along the horizontal axis, like a photo negative.

<center><img src='../Images/mirror.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

There are four quadrants, each with three stages, which are defined by the sequential lines (ring 6) of the intermediary trigram (ring 1).

**Ring 5:** Because the first 4 trigrams (<img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b00.png' style='width:30px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b01.png' style='width:30px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b02.png' style='width:30px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b03.png' style='width:30px'/>) all have Yin lines at the top-most position in the trigram we refer to them as ascending because they begin at 0 and ascend towards 7. Likewise, the next 4 trigrams (<img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b07.png' style='width:30px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b06.png' style='width:30px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b05.png' style='width:30px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b04.png' style='width:30px'/>) have Yang lines in their top-most positions, so we call these descending because they start with 7 and descend towards 0.

**Ring 4**: Because the upper hemisphere consists of 4 Yang lines and 2 Yin line (ring 6) and has the cardinal value of 7 (ring 8), it is predominantly Yang in nature. The opposite is true for the lower hemisphere which is predominantly Yin in nature.

## The Origin of Trigrams

We have yet to look closely at how a trigram evolves from nothing. Below is a binary tree that begins with a point of unity that divides itself into two states, 0 and 1. This establishes the most fundamental concept of Yin and Yang. This is then followed by each of those children doing the same by creating their own two children of 0 and 1. We can see that in 2 generations there are now 4 children, each defined by the parent’s fundamental Yin or Yang, and then adding to that the Yin or Yang of the child. These 4 children have the values 0, 2, 1, 3, as shown by the bigrams. This is done one more time to create the final branch of 8 children, each with a value determined by adding their Yin or Yang value to the bigrams passed down by the parents. Now we have 8 trigrams: 0, 4, 2, 3, 6, 1, 5, 3, 7. Unfortunately, this order seems to lack any symmetry or pattern that is compatible with our model, suggesting our model is incorrect.


<center><img src='../Images/btree-top.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

However, if we flip the tree upside down, like a mirror image, the order immediately appears! This is important when we are adding lines, because if we start with <img src='../Images/bc/bigram00.png' style='width:30px'/> and add a <img src='../Images/bc/yang.png' style='width:30px'/>, you might expect we get a <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b04.png' style='width:30px'/>, but as we will need to flip it to maintain the “mirrored” order, we will actually get a <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b01.png' style='width:30px'/>. Now we can see the first order of  {0,1}, the 2<sup>nd</sup> order of {0,1,2,3}, and the final and 3<sup>rd</sup> order of {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7}. Of course, we could also achieve this order if we only added new lines *below* the previous lines (which would also mean we need to write from left to right if we were using numbers instead of lines), but that would defeat the point of discovering this fascinating pattern where a top-down order naturally puts all the odd numbers on the right and all the even numbers on the left, but when we flip to bottom-up, the numbers change to their sequential order.

Now that we have our model in order, we can see if our trigrams fit into it in any way that makes sense. We do this simply by assigning the names of the trigrams that have the same values, while also assigning the first two branches of 0 and 1 to be that of the two branches of the Tholonic trigram, like this:


<center><img src='../Images/attr-btree.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

We may run into a problem of semantics and context using the words **Definition** and **Contribution** in this binary framework. The words Yin and Yang seem to fit much better, but it is difficult to say **Definition** is Yin and **Contribution** is Yang, as both can be both depending on the context. For now, we will say **Definition** is Yin as it aligns with the 0 side of the first 0/1 duality, and represents the absence of value but defines the ‘space’ for it, and **Contribution** is Yang as it aligns with the 1 side, as it represents the contribution of value within  that space.

We can see that every bigram creates two trigram children, and this pair of trigrams is always made up of one cardinal element and one dynamic element. This suggests that the parent is both a *state* (cardinal/stable) and an *energy* (dynamic/unstable) combined. This mirrors two properties that created the zero-dimensional point, where the *state* is the *awareness* of the concept of a point, and the *energy* is the *intention* to conceive it.

Both of these qualities exist in the bigram but can only find separation in the (trigram) children. We can also see that the nature of the energy is compatible with the nature of the state. Here we have a bit of a challenge because we do not have good words that describe these states and their movement, similar to the way “balance” is a state and a movement. Computer programming languages do have such a concept. It is called a “class,” and a class contains both static information and the dynamic code that can act on that information. We will have to make do with some borrowed and creative nouns and verbs.

***Absorb*** is a good word to describe the parent that results from the combined state of *Earth* and the energy of *Filling*. This parent must express a quality common to both elements. Absorption is the process by which something is *filled*, and *Earth*, being the pure Yin of 0, can do nothing but absorb and be filled. Other readers may find different terms that suit them better, and the words offered here are simply suggestions.

***Contract*** is used to describe the nature of *Water*, because water, which always travels the path of least resistance, will always pool, *Collecting* at the lowest point. Of course, all energy travels the path of least resistance, but *Water* is meant to describe that property.

***Consume*** describes the nature of *Fire*, as it consumes, or uses up or *empties* its fuel. This is almost the textbook definition of *Emptying*.

***Expand*** describes the nature of *Air*, as it will expand to define the “space” of reality. *Air* here does not simply mean the air we breathe, but refers more to the space that exists between all things, be they atoms or planets. If one considered the expanding universe as a function of *Air*, which was itself a function of the Big Bang, the verb of *Release* fits nicely. From this perspective, *Air* might also be the element of dark matter.

Here is an alternative way of looking at this model. Notice how all the horizontal pairs of pink dots equal 7, and all the pairs of orange dots equal 3, and how descriptions are opposite in nature for every pair.


<center><img src='../Images/btree-circ.png' style='width:60%'/></center>

With the introduction of bigrams, let’s look at the order of the trigrams again.


<center><img src='../Images/8-fold-1.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

The chart below shows the two dimensions of the bigram as described by their children. The cardinal elements are across the top, and the dynamic properties down the side. Using what we know about the trigrams, we can deduce the nature of the bigrams.


<center><img src='../Images/elementsgrid.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

Like the 32 paths of the 64 hexagrams, we also have 4 paths of the 8 trigrams.  Here is a brief overview:

Path 1: [1**☰**~7~ Initiation] ⬄ [*8**☷**~0~ Acceptance*] ⇨ **Creation** *(Action unified with receptivity)*
Path 2: [5**☴**~6~ Subtlety] ⬄ [*4**☳**~1~ Impulse*] ⇨ **Adaptation** *(Responsive interaction)*
Path 3: [3**☲**~5~ Clarity] ⬄ [*6**☵**~2~ Depth*] ⇨ **Insight** *(Perception unified understanding)*
Path 4: [7**☶**~4~ Stability] ⬄ [*2**☱**~3~ Joy*] ⇨ **Sustainability** *(Dynamic vitality, i.e., joy and inspiration, with structural endurance)*

While there may be many ways to create an order of the trigrams, the Tholonic model’s order continually re-validates itself every time we look at it from a different perspective. How, then, do these trigrams relate to a tholon? If we mapped the binary values to the tholon, the relationship is obvious and powerful, as shown in the graphic below.  This is the same map we showed previously, but here we are also looking at the trigrams, which show an entirely different dimension.



<center><img src='../Images/tri-paths-4.png' style='width:80%'/></center>

Here are some of the points spelled out:

**Orientation**

The arrangement of the trigrams are reversed between the value in a triad and the value on the opposing edge, suggesting that form and function are composed of the same properties, but in opposing contexts.  

In the hexagram-based paths map, The four elements align with the concept of *Perfection*, *Growth* is aligned with  *Collecting* and *Emptying*, and  *Refinement* is aligned with *Filling* and *Releasing*, which are conceptuality similar to the trigrams of *Growth*, suggesting that *Refinement* is the foundational to *Growth*.  In the trigram-basaed path map:

- *Perfection* is composed of *Insight*.
- *Growth* is composed of *Adaptation*.
- *Refinement* is composed of *Sustainability*.

**Symbolism**

The same two I Ching trigrams of 1 <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b01.png' style='width:30px'/> *Filling* and 6 <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b06.png' style='width:30px'/> *Release* exist in both the top triad and the opposing bottom <u>DC</u> edge. In the top triad they exist as the lower and upped trigram, respectively, to create *descending* side of the *Growth* path as hexagram [42䷩~49~ **Increase**], wherein it states:

> - *Sacrifice on the part of those above for the increase of those below*

Across the bottom <u>CD</u> edge, their position in swapped to create the *ascending* side of the *Growth* hexagram [*32䷟~14~ **Duration***], wherein it states:

> - *Duration is rather the self-contained and therefore self-renewing movement of an organized, firmly integrated whole, taking place in accordance with immutable laws and beginning anew at every ending.*
>
> **Example Tholons and Partons**
>
> The above diagram is a good example of tholons and partons. 
>
> We can see swapping the values of a triad with those of the opposing edge yields the values of the corresponding virtual tholon. This operation also inverts all the hexagrams to their opposites within the path to which each hexagram belongs.
>
> This is important because it shows how two trigrams can represent the internal functions (i.e. Increase) as a triad, and its interfacing edge, effectively acting as the *form*, of the the opposing vector.
>
> Thus, the primal tholon of a single line has two possible states, Yin or Yang. Three lines form a trigram tholon with eight states. Two trigrams combine to form a hexagram tholon with 64 states. Of thos 64 states, seven hexagrams explicitly form one 'real' tholon, which, along with its complementary 'virtual' state, forms a complete Tholonic structure.  This is a total of 14 partons and 19 tholons across 5 levels of self-similar expression to create one complete tholon.  that’s a lot of moving parts!
>
> **Perfect Coordination**

It would be difficult to argue that the symbolism of the I Ching and the and structural relationships if the tholons revealed here are merely pareidolic. 

While the traditional King Wen often perfectly represent the Tholonic symbolism, there a some interpretations that miss the mark, but this inaccuracy is easily understood given the bias or world view of the original interpretations and assigned meanings that date back thousands of years.  For example, in the hexagram [*63䷾ ~21~ **After Completion***], it states:

- *“Hence the present hexagram indicates the conditions of a time of climax, which necessitate the utmost caution.*
- *Thus the superior man takes thought of misfortune and arms himself against it in advance.”*

The sentiment here is that once something is perfect, only decay can follow, and one must prepare oneself for the ensuing problems. While this may be true, it does not capture the larger sentiment that once something has reached perfection or has been completed, its cycle of change has ended. More importantly, this completed cycle has contributed to the greater whole, changing it in the process. Rather than arming oneself and preparing for misfortune, the Tholonic position is to appreciate the creation, offer it up to the world, let it go, and move on in the same way an artist lays down his brush after he has finished his painting.  

This is the same sentiment behind the Buddhist sand mandala’s where monks, with great mindfulness and precision,  carefully place millions of grains of colored sand into an beautiful and elaborate mandala design, only to destroy it when it is finished as an act of non-attachment.  In this scenario, the act of destruction of the purpose of the creation, so the I Ching’s interpretations is not accurate or even relevant to the monk.  Fortunately, it is fairly easy to see past the world view to the larger Universal truth being stated.

Here is a more complete example showing how the I Ching reflects the Tholonic symbolism.

The **Definition** triad correlates  to the path of *descending* PERFECTION, formed by [64䷿ ~42~ **Before Completion**] as $\frac{Fire}{Water}$.The *function* of this triad symbolizes the striving towards perfection, emphasizing the *limitation* required to define and complete a state.

- *“Thus the superior man is careful in the differentiation of things, so that each finds its place.”*

It’s inverse on the **<u>CN</u>** edge  that returns **Contribution** to the parent is represented as [*63䷾ ~21~ **After Completion***] as $\frac{Water}{Fire}$ is the outer *form* or expression of its associated  *function*.

- *“[This] hexagram indicates the conditions of a time of climax”*

The **Contribution** triad correlates to the *ascending* path of REFINEMENT, shown through [*31䷞ ~28~ **Influence***] formed by $\frac{Collecting}{Emptying}$.  The function of this triad symbolizes the *mutual and harmonious integration between forces*.

- *“Thus the superior man encourages people to approach him by his readiness to receive them.”*

It’s inverse on the **<u>ND</u>** edge that begins a new definition is represented as [41䷨ ~35~ **Decrease**] formed by $\frac{Emptying}{Collecting}$ is the outer form of expression the instantiation of a new form.

- *“The lake at the foot of the mountain evaporates. In this way it decreases to the benefit of the mountain, which is enriched by its moisture.”*

In the center, a new tholon appears along the axis of *Growth*.  This triad has no opposing side, or rather, both sides have yet to be expressed.  This child tholon holds both hexagram [12䷋ ~56~ **Standstill**] formed by $\frac{Air}{Earth}$, and its function is clearly symbolized by the challenges one faces in the manifest world.

- *“Heaven is above, drawing farther and farther away, while the earth below sinks farther into the depths.”*

It’s opposing hexagram is that of [*11䷊ ~7~ **Peace***] formed by $\frac{Earth}{Air}$, and which is symbolizes by joining of heaven and earth.

- *“The Receptive, which moves downward, stands above; the Creative, which moves upward, is below. Hence their influences meet and are in harmony, so that all living things bloom and prosper.”*

Yet, neither of these functions has a form, or rather the form *is* it’s function and it’s function *is* its form. In other words, what something does determines what something is.  That is why this triad is correlated to the path of “Passage”, because this the the “way” of creation. By changing what something does, you change what it is, and by changing what it is, you change what it does. What something is, and what it does, is what determines if it exists on a path of disintegration and stagnation, or on the path of peace and harmony.

We can also see how *Equilibrium* interacts with the manifest world where the central triad touches all three outer edges of Refinement, Perfection and Growth, and bridges every neighboring triad. This *Equilibrium* triad, by both its symbolism and spatial position, serves as a fitting base of the tetrahedron, at least in the context of the Thologram, anchoring the system in the interaction between the abstract (air, heaven, Yang, <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b07.png' style='width:30px'/>) and the material (earth, Yin, <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b00.png' style='width:30px'/>).

On the cosmic scale, we can see a good example of an instance of this central triad in the Laniakea Supercluster, the largest known structure in the observable Universe.

Comparing the central triad to the Laniakea Supercluster might seem unusual, but it’s surprisingly fitting. At the heart of the Laniakea Supercluster lies the *Great Attractor*, a gravitational focal point pulling approximately 100,000 galaxies, including our Milky Way, across a region about 500 million light-years wide. Importantly, this gravitational attraction is not due to a massive black hole; rather, it emerges from the collective mass of the supercluster itself, making its center more of a place than a object, i.e., a function rather than a form.

Similarly, the central triad’s structure emerges naturally from functional interactions of balance, definition, and equilibrium, much like the gravitational dynamics defining Laniakea. Each structure inherently embodies its purpose: the supercluster integrates galaxies gravitationally to maintain cosmic balance and movement, while the central triad integrates hexagrams symbolically to achieve conceptual harmony. Both illustrate the Tholonic principles clearly: definition creates boundaries and identities; contribution fosters dynamic interactions; and negotiation harmonizes these processes into sustainable patterns. Despite their vast difference in scale, one cosmic, the other conceptual, both demonstrate the inseparable and mutually reinforcing relationship between form and function.

**Cosmic Metaphore**

Coincidentally, our journey to Laniakea provides an apt metaphor for the Tholon, illustrating its essential triad of equilibrium, holding together all other triads—perfection, growth, and refinement. Just as we find ourselves gravitationally drawn toward Laniakea, we are similarly drawn toward perfection, the ultimate limitation, which remains ever elusive as the universe expands, continually placing it beyond reach. Yet, precisely because we already exist within the gravitational embrace of Laniakea, this expansive drift is moderated, creating conditions in which our journey remains perpetually possible. This gravitational moderation represents the Tholon's equilibrium, the balanced negotiation of forces that binds together and sustains the dynamic interactions of perfection (as limitation), growth, and refinement (as integration). Thus, our journey within the supercluster mirrors the recursive sustainability of the Tholon itself, which endures and evolves as long as it maintains its integrated wholeness.

In explicitly Tholonic terms, the metaphor of our journey to Laniakea encapsulates the principle of **Negotiation**-**Definition**-**Contribution** (*NDC*). *Perfection* is the ultimate **Definition**/**Limitation**, a destination that defines the boundary and structure of our striving yet remains inherently unattainable. The expanding universe symbolizes the constant negotiation of forces—an equilibrium state where gravitational pull and expansive force are continually balanced, preventing collapse into perfection or dissolution into chaos. Our ongoing journey toward Laniakea symbolizes **Contribution** (**Integration**), illustrating how we continuously integrate our experiences, insights, and growth into the greater structure. The gravitational moderation, ensuring that the journey remains eternally achievable yet never completed, embodies the Tholonic state of stable negotiation, maintaining a recursive and sustainable balance between the **Definition** of perfection and the **Contribution** of perpetual refinement and growth.

**Perfect Integration**

The two paths that create this <u>CN</u> vector are also non-coincidentally matched:

*Descending* GROWTH: [42䷩*~49~* **Increase**], [*32䷟~14~ **Duration***] “*Sacrifice on the part of those above for the increase of those below.*”

*Ascending* REFINEMENT: [*31䷞~28~ **Influence***], [41䷨*~35~* **Decrease**] “*… their powers attract each other so that they unite*.”

<img src='../Images/32pairs.png' style='float:right; width:50%'/>The Tholonic interpretation of the I Ching reveals a clear structural relationship among *Growth*, *Perfection*, and *Refinement*, collectively forming the **????** "Passage," which embodies the path of *Equilibrium*.

When these paths are highlighted within the full sequence of paths, a compelling pattern emerges: each highlighted path is separated precisely by six paths. The path of *Equilibrium* appears immediately following the first six paths, succeeding the two foundational pairs, *Primordial Duality* and *Cycle of Influence*, that mark the beginning and end of the sequence.

Uniquely, *Equilibrium* stands apart as a Cardinal Path, distinguished from the other three. This arrangement not only ensures a perfectly even distribution of Tholonic attributes throughout the 64 hexagrams, reinforcing the internal symmetry and balance of the model, but also underscores the alignment and significance of these four paths within both the I Ching and the Tholonic framework.

## Binary Tholons  (doesn’t work?)

We have 6 lines in the hexagram and 6 vectors in a tetrahedron. If the Tholonic claim is that we should see similar patterns in both, then creating a tetrahedron from the lines should highlight these patterns.

In the image below (left), the Yang lines are cyan, and the Yin lines are magenta. The Yin/Yang sequence is that of the "perfect" hexagram, [*63䷾ ~21~ **After Completion***], and we do indeed see the same symmetry in the Tholon map (right), although rotated by 120°. This rotation appears to place **Definition**/**Limitation** at the top of the triad, but this perspective can be misleading, as there is no absolute "top" or "bottom." Such concepts are purely relative. What we can say definitively is that the Yang branch expands outward from **Definition**/**Limitation**, while the Yin branch completes or defines it. Although **Definition**/**Limitation** is inherently a Yin attribute, the outward Yang action requires this limitation for creation to form. This logic is perfectly mirrored in the right image, where ascending hexagrams (green) move from maximum Yin toward Yang, and descending hexagrams (red) move from maximum Yang back toward Yin.

<center><img src='../Images/line-tetra-compare.png' style='width:70%'/></center>

<img src='../Images/pyramid-bottom.png' style='float:right;width:20%'/>When viewed as a tetrahedron, we can see all the Yang lines at the base, creating a solid foundation. However, it is not the intuitive central triangle that serves as the base, but rather the top triad. This may seem counterintuitive at first, but it makes sense when we realize that the top triad is always identical to its parent—meaning it mirrors the original primal triad in every generation. In that sense, it serves as the true foundation of all tholons, making the base triad of every tholon identical to the first act of creation.

This contrast in orientation and perspective between the I Ching and Tholonic models is not contradictory, rather, it reflects a shift in viewpoint, much like the now-famous “Revolution Giraffes” sculpture, which reveals either giraffes or elephants depending on the angle of observation:

<center><img src='../Images/016-eleph-giraf.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

## Hexagrams

With the hexagrams in their binary order, we can put together the 64 hexagrams (below). Some of the hexagrams are identified as being made of trigrams that are: <img src='../Images/trigram_colors.png' style='width:25%'/>.  These attributes derived from the fundamental and basic I Ching.

***The Scope hexagrams:*** There are 2 (4 hexagrams)  pairs of *scope* hexagrams that are composed of only the primary (vertical/solstice) major cardinal  trigrams of *Air* <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b07.png' style='width:30px'/>~7~ and *Earth* <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b00.png' style='width:30px'/>~0~. These two trigrams define the *maximum* and *minimum*, or *north*/*Air* and *south/Earth* in the Tholonic *Pakua*, as shown previously. These hexagrams on the path of *The Primordial Duality*<img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB63.png' style='width:30px'/><img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB00.png' style='width:30px'/>and *Equilibrium* <img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB56.png' style='width:30px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB07.png' style='width:30px'/>. These tri/hexagrams are the *Negotiating* in nature.

***The Context hexagrams:*** There are 2 pairs (4 hexagrams) of *context* hexagrams that are compose of only the secondary (horizontal/equinox) major cardinal trigrams of *Fire* <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b02.png' style='width:30px'/>~2~ and *Water* <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b05.png' style='width:30px'/>~5~. These two trigrams define the area or *movement* within the *scope*.  In the Tholonic *Pakua* they are *west/Water* and *east/Fire*.  These hexagrams are on the path of *Guidance* <img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB45.png' style='width:30px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB18.png' style='width:30px'/> and  *Perfection* <img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB42.png' style='width:30px'/> <img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB21.png' style='width:30px'/>.  These tri/hexagrams are *Defining*/*Limiting* in nature.

***The Transitional hexagrams:*** There are 8 pairs (16 hexagrams) of *transitional* hexagrams formed by *Filling* <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b01.png' style='width:30px'/>~1~, *Releasing* <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b06.png' style='width:30px'/>~6~ and *Collecting* <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b03.png' style='width:30px'/>~3~,  *Emptying* <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b04.png' style='width:30px'/>~4~.  These tri/hexagrams are *Contributing/Integrating* in nature.

In the Tholonic Pakua, these minor cardinal trigrams transition between the major cardinal trigrams.

These three types of hexagrams account for 12 pairs, or 24 hexagrams that are derived from cardinal trigrams. The remaining 20 pairs, or 40 hexagrams, are a mixture of dissimilar trigrams that describe movement relative to these cardinal-class points.

<center><img src='../Images/64hexagrams-4.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

<img src='../Images/dot-pattern.png' style='float:right;width:30%'/>You can see the very self-similar pattern that emerges. Each quadrant above contains 16 hexagrams, but if we were to map these to the four sides of a tetrahedron, we would need exactly 15 hexagrams for a side. This can be easily accomplished if we isolate the four cardinal hexagrams as coordinate markers that define the limits. This is shown in the charts below where hexagrams 2<img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB00.png' style='width:20px'/>*~0~* and 1<img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB63.png' style='width:20px'/>*~63~* define the vertical min/max. These two hexagrams represent the points within which all the other hexagrams come into being. 

On a fascinating related note, in the images below, we have mapped the distribution of the *cumulative* Yin and Yang across matrices of increasing complexity, composed of upper and lower values. In the “2 bit” example, we begin with a simple 2-bit matrix containing the binary combinations 00, 01, 10, and 11. We then count how many of these combinations have zero 1s, how many have one 1s, and how many have two 1s, which in this case is as follows:

- Numbers with 0 ones: 1
- Numbers with 1 one:  2
- Numbers with 2 ones: 1
- 

<img src='../Images/0101.png' style='float:right;width:15%'/>The next number, 3 in this case, inherits the Yin/Yang map from 2 simply because the 2x2 is inevitably a part of the 3x3 grid. In this way every value represents a history of every value leading up to it. We then visualize these distributions on a 2x2 matrix, assigning the horizontal axis (x-values) as 0 and 1, and the vertical axis (y-values) also as 0 and 1. In these visualizations, the '1's, or Yang values, are represented by shades of red, while the '0's, or Yin values, are depicted in shades of blue. Together, these colors form a gradient spectrum, capturing all ranges between maximum Yin and maximum Yang.

The purpose of this visualization is to illustrate the dynamic interplay between emerging Yin (0) and emerging Yang (1). By mapping these interactions across matrices of increasing complexity, we reveal the intricate patterns that arise as numerical representations become progressively more complex. This process sheds light on the fundamental nature of binary interactions, reflecting deeper universal patterns found in the structure of reality itself.

<img src='../Images/grid-1.png' style='width:100%'/>

<img src='../Images/yinyangratios.png' style='float:right;width:50%'/>What we see is a self-similar pattern that first appears clearly in the 8-bit array, which shows 64 cells, with increasing resolution as we expand the range of numbers we are examining. By around 32 bits, we obtain a distinct image of a pattern that will persist regardless of how large the number becomes. As the numbers increase, the grid effectively "zooms out," revealing the next iteration of the same recurring pattern. Even when we reach the enormous value of approximately $1.23 \times 10^{903}$, the pattern remains consistent and clearly recognizable.  What is not immediately obvious is that the only numbers that are evenly Yin and Yang are numbers that are powers of 2, and the next number after that drops precipitously, and continues to drop before making its way back to a  balanced state.  Surprisingly, the number with the most Yin and least Yang of all numbers that exist, is the number 9, with a ~2/3 Yang/Yin ratio

OK, that was a (hopefully) interesting distraction, so let’s get back to the subject of rebuilding the I Ching.

We now have 62 hexagrams that we need to put into 60 places, but another problem exists as well: when we fill each triad with hexagrams, the sum of the hexagrams in the three corners has to equal 63. Without this consistency, the three outer triads will not be able to create the 4^th^ inner triad, which must follow the same pattern in order to maintain consistency and interconnectedness across all triads.  It turns out that the solution to one problem automatically solves the other problem.


<center><img src='../Images/tetrahex.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

The obvious two children of the primal coordinate pair hexagrams are [*11<img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB07.png' style='width:20px'/>~7~ **Peace***] and [12<img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB56.png' style='width:20px'/>*~56~* **Standstill**], and we can confirm this because of all the 31 remaining possible pairs that together equal their parents, this is the only cardinal pair. In addition, these 4 hexagrams are the only hexagrams that are created by the two defining trigrams of <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b07.png' style='width:30px'/> and <img src='../Images/bc/trigram-b00.png' style='width:30px'/>. Now, all major coordinate hexagrams are *defining* points that the remaining 60 hexagrams exist within.

These children quite naturally fit into the larger triads pattern with [12<img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB56.png' style='width:20px'/>*~56~* **Standstill**] as the *N*-state of the triad of *Limitation* (right triad) and [*11<img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB07.png' style='width:20px'/>~7~ **Peace***] as the *N*-state of the triad of **Contribution** (left triad).

At first glance, this arrangement looks very promising, as the primary cardinal (blue-framed) hexagrams occupy cardinal positions, and the sum of their binary values equals a multiple of 63. Initially, the patterns formed by the green and red cardinal hexagrams don't appear meaningful. However, upon combining the three outer trigrams, the green and red hexagrams form a complete triad. This result, by itself, is not particularly special, as any unique, symmetrical pattern would ensure that all dots are ultimately filled. The same logic applies to each quadrant containing four green dots and one red dot.

Nevertheless, this arrangement reveals a unique and significant aspect: the cardinal point of the [*2䷁~0~ **Receptive***] hexagram is positioned on a triad that is both opposite to the top triad and fundamentally incompatible with the other three triads. Remarkably, it defines the critical intersection where all three triads converge, yet it does not itself appear explicitly among the combined triads. This unusual configuration allows for the manifestation of the other three cardinal points, precisely due to the absence of this crucial cardinal point, representing zero (0), pure Yin, and the emptiness underlying duality itself.

Additionally, we observe that the left and right triads are symmetrical variations of the top triad, each rotated around the vertical (Z) axis. In contrast, the central triad is distinctively flipped around the horizontal (X) axis, rather than rotated around the Z-axis. This distinction introduces a genuine third dimension into the structure, significantly enhancing its complexity and depth.

It's also noteworthy that the triad formed by the red dots within the combined triads suggests a spiral element. Moreover, the smaller inner triangle formed by these points occupies exactly $\frac{7}{16}$ of the area of the outer triangle. This ratio is particularly intriguing because it is yet another instance of the numbers 7 and 16 appearing prominently, this time, together in a single relationship.

<center><img src='../Images/3tridots.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

There are several other validating patterns emerged that were pretty astounding.


<center><img src='../Images/tetrahex-hex-triplet-3.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

A truly astonishing pattern emerges when we add the totals of the green hexagrams (context, **Defining/Limiting**) for each triad:  the left and right triads are 7-based, and the center triad are 6 based, and this holds true for the red (transitional, **Contribution/Integration**) values as well.  We also see the right traid’s  red value is double the left triad’s red value, and the all the red values times 4 equal the green’s total value.

Of course, all these relationships are easily explained with math and geometry, but to see them so well integrated, or perhaps even fundamental, to an ancient Taoist philosophic treatise and how they validate the symbolism of I Ching and the Tholonic model is exciting to discover.

***Things to notice***

Every value within this system can be expressed using formulas derived solely from the first four prime numbers, or the values themselves are prime numbers. Notably, the sum of all values in the central Tholonic trigram equals 216, or 6×6×6, and intriguingly, 216 divided by 63 equals exactly $\frac{24}{7}$ (approximately 3.42857). While it may be tempting to dismiss this as a mere coincidence, it is worth considering that the ancient Egyptians and Babylonians, who employed base-60 and base-12 numerical systems, might have similarly adopted numeric frameworks based on symbolic or mathematical reasoning, especially in light of the fact that these cultures were highly symbolic. The commonly accepted historical explanation attributes their use of the 24-hour day and the 7-day week primarily to astronomical observations of celestial cycles. However, there is no explicit historical evidence conclusively proving that observational astronomy alone dictated these numeric divisions. Therefore, it remains plausible, and indeed reasonable, that these cultures originally established numeric divisions based on inherent symbolic or mathematical structures, which were subsequently integrated into their astronomical and observational frameworks.

Notice how each of the four child triads in ***Fig. h3a***, and by implication, ***Fig. h3***, have values (36, 27, 21, 42), which are also the natural pairs of {36, 27}, *Dignity* (green framed) and 21, 42, *Perfection* (red framed, cardinal). Notice also how the pair of *Dignity* is on the vertical axis and the pair of *Perfection* is on the horizontal axis.

[52<img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB36.png' style='width:20px'/>~36~ **Keeping Still**] and [*58*<img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB27.png' style='width:20px'/>*~27~* ***Joyous***] (transitional, *Dynamic Equilibrium*)

[*63*<img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB21.png' style='width:20px'/>*~21~*  ***After Completion***] and [64<img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB42.png' style='width:20px'/>~42~ **Before Completion**] (balanced, *Perfection*)

This is a quite remarkable association, as it perfectly describes the archetypes of duality of movement and balance as the two axes within which the hexagrams exist. It also tells us that the movement precedes balance, as the values between the first duality of [*2*<img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB00.png' style='width:20px'/>*~0~*] and [1<img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB63.png' style='width:20px'/>~63~] are those of *Dynamic Equilibrium* and the created children, that between [*11*<img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB07.png' style='width:20px'/>*~7~*] and [12<img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB56.png' style='width:20px'/>~56~] creates the balance needed in the *Completion Cycle*.  This claim is fully supported by Newtons Second Law of Motion, *F=ma*, which clearly demonstrates that equilibrium or balance occurs only when acceleration (movement) becomes zero. Therefore, movement is a necessary precursor to achieving balance.

The vertical values always sum to 63 and the horizontal values always sum to 63, making it very clear that there are two axis formed by the primary and secondary cardinal values.

The patterns in this Tholonic layout of the I Ching strongly confirm the compatibility of these two models.

Using the above framework, we can create a sequence of the I Ching based on the Tholonic model above:


<center><img src='../Images/t-sequence.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

***Things to Notice***

Because the four cardinal points define the framework and do not make up the dynamic part of the circle, there are exactly 60 points on the circle.

Again, this perspective aligns closely with the ancient Babylonian approach to time measurement, specifically their introduction of the 60-second minute and the 60-minute hour. Modern explanations often suggest that the Babylonians adopted 360 degrees because it approximated their estimate of the days in a year. However, this oversimplified interpretation overlooks the sophistication of ancient Babylonian society, renowned for its precision in navigation, architecture, agriculture, astronomy, and governance. It seems implausible that they would have failed to accurately count the number of days in a year or simply ignored extra days. A more convincing explanation is that the Babylonians chose the number 60 due to its mathematical elegance and foundational role in nature, as 60 is a highly composite number, the product of the first three prime numbers: 2²×3×5. Moreover, 2²×3 equals 12, which directly corresponds to the widely adopted division of the day into two sets of 12 hours, a system independently utilized by ancient Egyptian and Chinese cultures. This numerical harmony suggests that the selection of these numbers was based on deeper mathematical reasoning rather than mere observational convenience.

- Here is what you can do with 2, 3, and 5
- $2 × 3 × 5$ = 6 × 5 = **30**
- $2^2 × 3 × 5$ = 4 × 3 × 5 = **60**
- $2 × 3^2 × 5$ = 2 × 9 × 5 = **90**
- $2^3 × 3 × 5$ = 8 × 3 × 5 = **120**
- $2^2 × 3^2 × 5$ = 4 × 9 × 5 = **180**
- $2 × 3^3 × 5$ = 2 × 27 × 5 = **270**
- $2^3 × 3^2 × 5$ = 8 × 9 × 5 = **360**

While the numbers are not sequential, each pair of opposites equals 63. I have added the octal (base 8) value because it is far more clear. Base-8, if you are not familiar with octals, it is simply a number system that is based on the eight values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. This means when you are counting and you get to 8, you have to start with the double digits, so our base-10 number 8 in octal is written as “10”.


<center><img src='../Images/decoct.png' style='width:70%'/></center>

The beauty of using octal numbers for the I Ching is the number itself is telling you what trigrams it’s made of. For example, hexagram [*62䷽**~12~***]  as a binary value of 12 (001100), which, in octal, is ***o***14 (we use ‘***o***’ for octal numbers, and ***‘b’*** for binary). Hexagram [*62䷽**~12~***] is composed of two trigrams: 001 and 100. We convert from binary to octal: ***b***001 = ***o***1, and ***b***100 = ***o***4. Then we simply put the two numbers next to each other to get ***o***14. This ability to add numbers just by putting them together only works when converting binary base<sub>2</sub>, octal base<sub>8</sub>, hexadecimal base<sub>16</sub>, base<sub>32</sub>, or any base that is a power of 2. Perhaps that is why some ancient Native American and Proto-Indo-European cultures (allegedly) chose to use the octal system.

Numbers are not as intuitive as images, so here are a couple of charts based on the above sequence that clearly show the self-similarity triad pattern of the sequence

The graph on the left (below) plots each of the quadrants in the sequence above by the position in the sequence. Each quadrant has 15 positions (the Y axis), and there are 64 hexagrams (the X axis). The self-similar pattern of a larger triad whose two sides are made of smaller triads becomes quite clear. The middle plot shows the outline of that same plot, showing an extended or virtual self-similar pattern in light gray, which is better shown in the rightmost plot.

These plots show how the I Ching almost reconstructs the Thologram from scratch.

## Cross-Models: Astrology and the I Ching

This section demonstrates how the I Ching and the Thologram align with other rational systems. Some may question the rationality of astrology, yet it undeniably possesses philosophical and symbolic rationality. While astrology might not fully conform to modern scientific criteria, it undeniably has roots in scientific observation and reasoning. If it did not, astronomy could not have evolved from astrology during the Scientific Revolution of the 16th and 17th centuries. Given that the primary objective of the Tholonic model is to unify scientific, symbolic, and philosophical perspectives, astrology clearly warrants serious investigation and consideration.

The fundamental structure that the I Ching and related Eastern thinking is built on is essentially the same as the model for astrology and related Western thinking. This is not at all surprising, as both cultures were observing the same laws and patterns in action. However, if we find where they combine and overlap, we can understand one model that encompasses both.

In astrology, each sign is assigned an element property of *Fire*, *Earth*, *Air*, or *Water*, and a characteristic of Cardinal, Fixed, or Mutable. This makes twelve signs. We can easily see how the 6 lines of the I Ching/thologram would fit neatly into twelve, but if we want to understand the why's and how's, we have to go deeper. The first requirement for association is not only that the six lines have to map to twelve signs, but the twelve signs need to be mapped to a *complete* tholon, which is a tholon map and its virtual double.

We start by assigning the most fundamental concepts of the I Ching, which are 1 <img src='../Images/bc/yang.png' style='width:35px'/> and 0 <img src='../Images/bc/yin.png' style='width:35px'/> and their virtual counterparts, to the most fundamental signs of astrology, which are the cardinal signs in the following manner:

**Cardinals**

The spectrum between **Definition** and **Contribution** is the Tholonic polarity that creation exists within. Aires, the first fire sign and only cardinal fire sign, is mapped to **Contribution**. Fire is the definition of contribution as it gives at a cost to itself. Fire is the contribution of light and heat at the sacrifice of that which keeps it alive. Capricorn, a cardinal earth sign, is ruled by the Great Limiter itself, Saturn, so there is no question that it fits in the space of **Definition** quite nicely. Aires and Capricorn are not opposite to each other, but they are the most dissimilar to each other and are perpendicular to each other. They represent two different dimensions. 

The virtual counterpart to Aires, or the reflection of Aires' energy, is Libra, the sign of equilibrium and balance. This is poetically satisfying as the act of fire is the process of a transformation that ends in balance. In the astrological framework, this is the spectrum or axis of ***I Am↔I Balance***. The virtual counterpart of Capricorn is the nurturing and protective Cancer, which creates the ***I Use↔I Feel*** axis.

**Fixed and Mutable**

Leo, like the sun that rules it, is the instantiation of fire, and like all instances, it is limited by its context: think sun vs. campfire. Its virtual counterpart is the world-changing, innovative Aquarius. This is the ***I Will↔I Know*** spectrum.

Taurus consuming nature’s counterpart is the penetrating Scorpio. This is the ***I Have ↔ I Desire*** spectrum.

The counterpart to the wise Sagittarius is the witty Gemini, creating the ***I Understand ↔ I Think***

The counterpart to the analytical Virgo is the edge-surfing Pisces, creating the ***I Analyze↔I Believe*** spectrum


<center><img src='../Images/astrigridv2_1.png' style='width:80%'/></center>

In the above chart, we assign the same Yin/Yang values for the elements and Tholonic descriptions as we have been using all along. **Negotiation** has no value (because it is both values combined). In the lower left of each cell is the binary value (and the decimal equivalent) of the column and row. In the left two columns, we have six cells made up of two primary lines and four cells made up of bigrams. The right is the virtual equivalent, which is consistent with the scheme of duality that exists in both models.

We have to decide in what order the binary values should be assigned. For example, column *Earth*~0~ and row **Definition**~1~ we can create the pair of 10 (row/col) or 01 (col/row), depending on which comes first, the column or the row. How do we choose the order? The first thing to understand is that either order is correct, as they are two different perspectives of the same thing. In our case, we want to select the order that displays the most symmetry and coherence.

<img src='../Images/math2.png' style='float:right;width:20%'/>When comparing the two methods of listing values, column/row (col/row) versus row/column (row/col), we find that the col/row method reveals a clearer symmetry and pattern. The image on the right demonstrates this comparison: the col/row arrangement (right side) is distinctly more structured than the row/col arrangement (left side).

Due to this clearer symmetry, we will adopt the col/row method for determining positions within the tholon. In the corresponding astrological associations (shown below), the signs consisting exclusively of either Yang (1 <img src='../Images/bc/yang.png' style='width:35px'/>) or Yin (0 <img src='../Images/bc/yin.png' style='width:35px'/>) form the four outer boundaries, while the bigrams are located inside the Tholonic structure.


<center><img src='../Images/tho-ast-bin.png' style='width:80%'/></center>

The cardinal signs, composed exclusively of single-line types—either Yang (1 <img src='../Images/bc/yang.png' style='width:35px'/>) or Yin (0 <img src='../Images/bc/yin.png' style='width:35px'/>)—correspond neatly with all the **Negotiation** signs. For example, the left side of the upper tholon consists of *Earth*–*Fire*–*Earth*, sharing a common boundary defined by the cardinal *Earth* sign, Capricorn.

Additionally, the diagonal axis leading into the virtual (lower) tholon extends from Leo to Taurus, positioned symmetrically relative to the Capricorn cusp. This diagonal crosses into the lower right section of the virtual tholon, which is characterized by *Air*–*Air*–*Water*, situated between Gemini and Aquarius. This pair is similarly centered around their shared boundary, the cardinal *Air* sign, Libra.

This structural pattern repeats consistently across all four quadrants. Significantly, the **Negotiation** signs, which represent child *N*-states, form the outer boundary, providing the context necessary to generate new child instances. Conversely, all non-*N*-state signs converge toward the central Tholonic N-cluster, representing the parent *N*-state.



<img src='../Images/tho-ast-bin_leo_aqu_zod.png' style='float:right;width:100%'/>A historically intriguing observation emerges when examining the two central triangles that intersect at the center of the astrological tholon depicted above. Prior to the discovery of the extra-Saturnian planets (Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto), the cusp connecting Leo and Aquarius represented a highly significant division within traditional astrology. In the far-right image above, the zodiac is oriented so that this Leo–Aquarius axis is vertical.

Interestingly, rather than aligning neatly with the four cardinal points marking the seasons (spring/fall equinoxes or summer/winter solstices), the Leo–Aquarius cusp is offset by 30° from the solstices and 60° from the equinoxes. This arrangement creates a distinctive planetary pattern that appears asymmetrical relative to the seasonal divisions, yet maintains a symmetrical balance around the Leo–Aquarius axis—highlighting its historical importance as a fundamental dividing line in classical astrological tradition.

The three axes created by dividing the 12 zodiac signs into elemental groups, that is, each axis corresponding to one set of four elements, clearly reveal a meaningful pattern from the Tholonic perspective. The two additional diagonal axes in the zodiac chart directly align with the outer borders of the Tholonic model. This alignment alone offers strong validation, but an even more remarkable observation emerges regarding the placement of the spring equinox within this adjusted zodiac orientation. Specifically, the spring equinox aligns precisely at the 4:00 position, which we've previously identified as marking the start of a new daily cycle.

You might reasonably question this alignment, thinking: *"If we're moving clockwise, we'd be traversing the zodiac backward. If we flip the zodiac to correct this, wouldn't the spring equinox then appear at 8:00 rather than 4:00?"* Indeed, that would be true if we were observing only the annual cycle. However, when considering the *precession of the equinoxes*—a 25,772-year cycle caused by Earth's gradual axial shift—the perspective changes dramatically. Precession causes the equinox points to slowly drift westward through the zodiac, opposite to the annual eastward movement. Thus, this reversed, clockwise traversal through the signs accurately represents the larger, precessional cycle.

This insight gives us a unified timeframe, compatible with both models, within which all planetary and zodiacal relationships can be understood. Specifically, the 4:00 position signifies the start of a major new cycle, corresponding historically to the *Age of Pisces*, which began around *1 BCE to 1 CE*.

Remarkably, this alignment is the first clear demonstration, at least to my knowledge, that the precession of the equinoxes could be directly inferred from the zodiac itself.

Following this interpretation, if the 4:00 position signifies the start of a new cycle around 1 BCE to 1 CE, then our most recent symbolic "midnight” and/or “high noon" occurred around 8,650 BCE. This date aligns historically with the end of the Younger Dryas period and the close of the Pleistocene Ice Age, marking humanity’s transition into the Holocene Epoch. It was precisely during this transformative period that humans shifted towards agriculture and established permanent settlements, notably at Göbekli Tepe in Turkey and Jericho in the West Bank—one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. This era also closely follows a series of hypothesized catastrophic events [^3][^4][^5][^6][^7][^8][^9][^10] that may have led to the rapid extinction of numerous large animal species and potentially disrupted or erased previously advanced civilizations, as suggested by various researchers [^11][^12].

## The Lines

##### Note: Except for the graphic at the end of this chapter, the red and blue text used in the tables below is not related to the RGB colors of the tholon as has been used up until now. They were chosen for their ease of readability and contrast*.

There is another compelling reason to consider astrology alongside the Tholonic model. As illustrated earlier by the number wheel and tholon, astrology inherently consists of six attribute pairs, each pair representing complementary perspectives of a unified, overarching *uber* concept. Remarkably, these pairs correspond neatly with the six lines of change found in the I Ching. By applying the logic of the Tholonic I Ching and binary systems to astrology, we obtain the detailed chart presented below:

<center><img src='../Images/tho-zod.png' style='width:70%'/></center>

Here's how to interpret the chart clearly:

- **Color-coding:**
  - Blue text represents Yang attributes.
  - Red text represents Yin attributes.
- **Background shading:**
  - Yellow backgrounds represent Inner states, aligning with the *real* or upper triad in the tholon.
  - Green backgrounds represent Outer states, aligning with the *virtual* or lower triad in the tholon.

Each Tholonic property (**Negotiation**, **Definition**, **Contribution**) manifests in four distinct states within any given context. For instance, considering the property of **Negotiation** within the context of **NATURE**, the possible states are:

- Activity (Inner-Yang)
- Nurturing (Inner-Yin, default)
- Harmony (Outer-Yang, default)
- Ambition (Outer-Yin)

The default state for any context is determined by matching the intrinsic nature (Yin or Yang) of the property to the nature of its context. Thus, a Yin attribute within a Yin context (Inner-Yin) or a Yang attribute within a Yang context (Outer-Yang) is considered a default state.

This structured presentation clarifies the previously hidden connections between astrology, the Tholonic model, and the binary interpretations of the I Ching, highlighting their compatibility and mutual reinforcement.

- Below is an explanation of how the information from the chart above can be applied to the hexagram structure shown here:

  <center><img src='../Images/tho-zod-2.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

  To validate this relationship, let's carefully examine the progression of the I Ching’s “Nature” column, observing how clearly the inner (yellow) and outer (green) definitions align with each step in the hexagram process:

  - **INCEPTION** (**Negotiation**, Harmony):
     	Represents the balanced foundation needed to initiate any new state or concept.
  - **SPECIFICATION** (**Definition**, Stability):
     - Must be clear, stable, and consistent to establish firm boundaries and criteria.
  
  - **DEPLOYMENT** (**Contribution**, Visualization):
     - Requires envisioning how the concept will manifest and integrate within its intended context.
  
  - **EMERGENCE** (**Negotiation**, Nurturing):
     - Involves careful guidance and attention, as emerging conditions are vulnerable and full of uncertainty.
  
  - **SYNTHESIS** (**Definition**, Imagination):
     - Marks the stage of peak expression and fulfillment, creatively combining previously separate elements into a cohesive whole.
  
  - **DIFFUSION** (**Contribution**, Practicality):
     - Signifies the phase of integration back into the larger context, ensuring the creation’s impact and legacy are preserved.
  
  
  This alignment demonstrates a coherent, structured correspondence between the Tholonic framework, astrological attributes, and the hexagram sequence, validating the robustness and consistency of the model.

Let’s make this even simpler to illustrate another point.

<center><img src='../Images/tho-zod-3.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

If we were to apply the above charts to hex [64<img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB21.png' style='width:20px'/>~21~ ***After Completion***] and [63<img src='../Images/bc/hexagramB42.png' style='width:20px'/>~42~ **Before Completion**] using the values from the “Nature” and “Personal” columns, we would get the following:

<center><img src='../Images/tho-zod-4.png' style='width:80%'/></center>

This shows that, according to the Tholonic model using traditionally Western values, the archetype of INCEPTION in a “Natural” context is *Harmony*, and its inverted concept is *Activity*. Likewise, on a more individual, subjective front, the archetype of INCEPTION is *I Balance*, and its inverted concept is *I Am*. Looking at all the pairs, we see the same well-matched dualities.

There remains one final step: reducing the twelve astrological attributes down to six overarching pairs. This step is straightforward, and the resulting structure is illustrated clearly in the left-hand image below. We've included the blue text circle to label the unified qualities represented by each pair—qualities previously expressed as twelve separate attributes in Western astrology. These six primary attributes align neatly and intuitively with the pink circle representing the corresponding attributes of the six lines of change in the I Ching.

On the right is the previously discussed diagram depicting the eight trigrams. Together, these two images—lines (left) and trigrams (right)—present complementary yet distinct creation models. The “Lines Model” (left) follows the Tholonic pattern: starting with one entity, which generates two; these two then mirror to produce six; and finally, through inversion, produce twelve. By contrast, the “Trigrams Model” (right) employs a binary tree pattern: beginning with one entity that divides into two, each subsequently dividing again, yielding four, and then each dividing once more to produce eight.

Together, these models illustrate the harmonious interplay of Tholonic logic and binary structure, effectively bridging Eastern (I Ching) and Western (astrology) frameworks.
