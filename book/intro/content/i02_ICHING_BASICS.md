# II: Foundations of the I Ching

## Patterns, Principles, and Structure


The I Ching’s trigrams, like the thologram’s triangle or triad, is seen as the concept of a the stable building block of structure. In the I Ching, a trigram is simply three states of yin/yang together to form a stable concept. There are eight possible combinations when using yin and yang (shown below).

<img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/i-ching-8.png" style='float:right;width:20%'/>The I Ching also has a concept of a “lower” and an “upper” state. It describes the lower state as earth, matter, the subjective, the hidden, the inner, etc. depending on context, and the “upper” state as that of heaven, ideas, archetypes, the outer, exposed and the arena of creation, etc, also depending on context. Just as the yin and yang lines represent the two states of something, the upper and lower trigrams represent the two states of the stable concept created by the three lines of the trigram. Already we see the self-similar properties of dualities of trinities as shown in the thologram as well.

Pairing these eight upper trigrams with the eight lower trigrams results in a total of 64 hexagrams, shown below (even values are blue, odd values are red for easier viewing). The number under the hexagram is the binary value of the hexagram when considering yin as 0 and yang as 1. This was the original Fu Xi arrangement before the current King Wen (~1154 BCE, Zhou Dynasty) order was introduced.

While there are 64 hexagrams, it is more useful to think of two different sets of 32 pairs of hexagrams. The reason this is more useful is that we can consider these 32 pairs as 32 singularities that instantiate in two different forms depending on the context.

##### Note: For clarity, referring to hexagrams can take the following form of **2䷁*~0~* the *Receptive***, where **2** is the traditional or King Wen number of the hexagram, **䷁** is the hexagram itself, and the small-italic ***~0~*** is the binary value of the hexagrams when yang=1 and yin=0. The name, ***Receptive***, is the traditional name, which may differ from the Tholonic I Ching name. Unless noted, all the hexagram name in this document are the traditional names.

For example, take the most basic hexagrams: 2䷁*~0~* the *Receptive*, and 1䷀*~63~* the *Creative*. Between these two hexagrams, all other hexagrams exist, so together, as a pair, they represent one state that includes the broadest context that everything exists within. Another example is the pair of hexagrams 39䷦*~20~* *Obstruction*, which states, “*When faced with dangerous obstacles it is wise to retreat and prepare accordingly with those of like mind*,” and its opposite, 38䷥*~43~* *Diverging Perspectives* or *Opposition*, which states, “*When opposites meet they must proceed with care, for brusqueness will lead to calamity, but through understanding and cooperation we can change an opposition into a polarity. This is how all things come into being*.”

The *meta* concept here is one of opposites and how they can interact either through polarity as cooperation or conflict.  We examine these pairs further on, but for now it it useful to keep this concept in mind.



## Mapping Trigrams to the Tholonic Model


##### *Note: To avoid confusion, a tholonic triple, which is essentially a triangle, is called a “triad” to distinguish from the I Ching’s “trigram”.*

A tholonic triad is a bit different from, but quite compatible with, the I Ching trigram. Instead of three states that the I Ching defines as beginning, middle, end, or earth, man, heaven, the triad is made of a source and the two polar opposites that emerge from that source, something like a *synthesis* that holds within it its own but yet unexpressed   *thesis* and *antithesis*. The three lines of a trigram and the three points of a triad correlate with *NDC*.

The thologram also has a concept of *upper* and *lower* in that the *upper* trigram of the I Ching, which comes *after* the *lower* trigram, equates nicely to the *child* triad of a tholon, which comes *after* or *within* the parent. In other words, the *lower* I Ching trigram is the *parent* triad of the thologram, and the *upper* I Ching trigram is the *child* triad of the tholon. We can now see that the final hexagram is perfectly equivalent to a 2D tholon map.


<center><img src='../Images/tri-is-hex.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

It might seem counterintuitive that the *upper* or *outer* trigrams of the I Ching equate to the smaller embedded triads of the thologram, but in the tholon it is the smallest and most embedded tholons that represent the bleeding edge of reality where new creations are being born, dying, and morphing. The farther “up” the thologram, the more fundamental the changes. In the thologram, the parent triad is what forms the environment or context for a new negotiated (i.e., stable) instance to come into existence, so the parent triad is the incubator, so to speak, for the yet-to-be-manifest *N*-state and its own duality. The smaller, inner triad inside the parent is where the newly created *N*-state creates its own environment, which incubates yet another *N*-state, and so on.

If the thologram recurses inward and not outward, does this mean that all creations exist *within* the initial tetrahedron, or tholon, that is created by this primal; parent and child triad? Conceptually, yes, within which are an infinite number of embedded tetrahedrons across an infinite number of generations.

##### Note: One interesting detail is when we use the outer triad on the parent level with the inner triad on the child level; all the numbers, as indicated on the image above, for each side equal 9, (1+6+2), (2+4+3), (3+5+1), but if we associated the lower trigram with the inner triad, and the upper trigram with the outer triad, all the numbers for each side equal 12, (4+3+5), (5+1+6), (6+2+4). 9 is a smaller number and is more efficiently expressed and is self-similar  (3<sup>3</sup>) unlike 12, which means it has “less resistance” than the larger, less sophisticated, and more complex 12 (2<sup>2</sup>×3 - see appendix for more on this). That does not mean other mappings are incorrect, just that this one is the most efficient and therefore more likely to occur.



## The Six Stages (I Ching and Thologram)


According to the I Ching, there are 6 stages of change that describe the life-cycle of a creation or instance. This is stated very clearly:

-   *“All movements are accomplished in **six stages**, and the seventh brings return.”*

*<sub>~Hexagram 24 “Return”</sub>*

-   “The holy man, who understands the mysteries of creation inherent in end and beginning, becomes superior to the limitations of the transitory. For him, the meaning of time is that in it, the stages of growth can unfold in a clear sequence. He is mindful at every moment and uses the **six stages of growth** as if they were six dragons on which he mounts to heaven.”

*<sub>~Commentary on hexagram 1, the Creative (Wilhelm/Baynes edition).</sub>*

This shows a general idea of the six steps from an I Ching and tholonic perspective. We can see these same six stages in modern applications, one of the many examples being the popular *Transtheoretical Model*[^24] used for addressing issues of growth, recovery, behavior, production, etc. We will use these archetypal qualities as properties of the six lines, not simply because it’s a reasonable presumption, but because the original I Ching texts support these definitions, as will be shown.

To show these similarities, we will use the hexagram 63䷾*~21~* *After Completion*, which represents the “perfect” or ideal order of the hexagrams.


<center><img src='../Images/simple_lines-1.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

Here is another way to look at the tholonic/I Ching relationship:


<center><img src='../Images/line-tao.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

One way to understand the 6 stages is by looking at the 6 steps of bifurcation needed to create 64 children from one source. Notice how the 1<sup>st</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> level of bifurcation (blue shaded line) are the tholonic *Negotiation* line, which is the only area where new *N*-states can form to create potential tholons. These lines are the lines of the archetypes of *Inception* and *Emergence*, representing the starting line of each of the two trigrams.


<center><img src='../Images/ic-btree-labels.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

Another way of looking at the 6 stages is by comparison. In the image below, I have tried to select the best concepts to map together solely based on what “made sense” to me. I am sure there is a better, more verifiable metric to base these on, so these are shown as examples, not as claims.

In the “Tholon” diagram below, the numbers in the center triangle are in their tholonic order of 0, 5, 1, 3, 2, 4, and in the other two diagrams, they are in the I Ching order of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.


<center><img src='../Images/colorfog-tri2.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

Look at the numbered triangle in the “Plant Instance” above. Note the qualities of the points that form the corners (which are yang in nature), such as 1, 3, and 5 (GERMINATE, BLOOM, SEED) that form the connecting lines (which are yin in nature) 2, 4, and 6 (growth, fruiting, recycle). Look at the quality of the pairs that are composed of a point and its opposite line. For example, there are three such pairs: GERMINATE/fruiting, BLOOM/recycle, and SEED/growth. We can understand these pairs as the conceptual polarities of the 3 parent concepts:

-   **The Beginning** (germination, reproduction)
-   **The Limits** (blooming and death)
-   **The Work**: What “it must do” as an existence (it must sustain its existence, i.e., produce seeds, growth).

In the Tholonic order of numbers, each side and its points equals 6,6,6, while in the I Ching order, they equal 6, 12, 12.   Both follow a similar pattern where 6×6×6 = 216, and 6×12×12=864=216×4, but 6^3^ is more symmetrical, balanced, self-similar, simpler, and comes with a host of references that work well for this model, which includes mathematical properties[^28][^29], number symbolism[^22][^23], astronomical relevance [^19], religious and mystical references[^17][^18], and the (likelihood)  that Plato called 216 the "Perfect Number"[^20][^21].

There is yet another way to look at the structure of the lines, and one that is arguably the basis of the current King Wen interpretation of the I Ching.


<center><img src='../Images/dot-cicrle-ary.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

***Fig. k1*** shows a simple binary tree that starts at the center and bifurcates outward to 64 end-points. This form is especially useful because it so clearly shows the direction of the YIN movement (***Fig. k2a***) and the YANG movement (***Fig. k2b***), and when we add these two opposite moving patterns together we can see an impressive self-similar fractal pattern (***Fig. k3***). ***Fig. k4*** shows the dots and the lines together, but in addition, each of the six concentric bands has been colorized according to their *NDC* correlation, and the connective lines have been greatly thickened, with a Taijitu symbol added to the middle to represent the original duality.


<center><img src='../Images/dot-circle-anatomy.png' style='width:80%'/></center>

Each of these concentric rings represents each successive bifurcation, which defines each of the lines in a hexagram. The above image shows the path from the beginning to the end for hexagram 5䷄*~23~* *Waiting/Nourishment*.

Below are all 64 hexagrams represented and the paths of the cardinal point highlighted, producing a star-chart where the innermost value is the octal (base-8) value in mono-spaced text. The next ring of values is the binary value in decimal, then the King Wen name of the hexagram, and then the King Wen number of the hexagram.

<center><img src='../Images/dot-circle-64.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

This structure tells us a lot about the I Ching. For example, this sequence is the most naturally occurring pattern, and by natural, we mean the most organically formed and the most obvious in nature itself as well as following the *law of least energy*. In this <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/64-plot.png" style='float:right;width:30%'/>pattern, we can clearly see the fractal and self-similar nature of the pattern that is made obvious by the procession of the octal values, which follows a pattern shown on the right of two identical sets that are naturally offset by an X value of 1. We can also see the four major cardinal points (North, East, West, South) hold a unique value that clearly identifies them as cardinal in nature, as do the clear but different values that identify the minor cardinal points (NE, NW, SE, SW). Notice every hexagram has its perfect opposite value (i.e., both values sum to 63) on the horizontally opposite side.

To see this last example better, we highlighted the paths of each of the cardinal and semi-cardinal paths and show the hexagrams they produce along with their traditional name and meaning as per Wilhelm/Baynes[^13], with their traditional King Wen sequence number in parentheses.

[^13]: **Wilhelm, Richard, and Cary F. Baynes, trans.** *The I Ching or Book of Changes.* Princeton University Press, 1967

On the right, we show the overarching theme of the two hexagrams that join at the cardinal points.


<center><img src='../Images/dot-circle-3a-2.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

In addition, each perfect pair (a hexagram and its inverse form together) has its own *theme* or *context* that exists with these cardinal themes. In other words, in the context of the cardinal themes, it is the two adjacent hexagrams that define it, even though the hexagrams may not be a perfect pair, while the 32 perfect pairs are made of only perfectly inverse or opposite hexagrams. One interesting observation, of the 8 cardinal pair themes and the 32 pair themes, the only pairs that are the same in both contexts are 2䷁*~0~* ***Receptive*** ⇔ 1䷀*~63~* **CREATIVE** and 24䷗*~1~* ***Return*** ⇔ 44䷫*~62~* **COMING TO MEET**, which are the first 2 of the of the 32 pairs and also define the limits of the entire I Ching, suggesting that this pair defines an even broader parent theme of “Movement within duality.”

Here is a brief overview of this fundamental concept of pairs in the I Ching, specifically, the concepts of *ascending* and *descending* hexagrams.

***Ascending*** hexagrams have a yin line in the 6<sup>th</sup> place and have a binary value less than 32, and are shown in italics-bold for easy identification.

**DESCENDING** hexagrams have a yang line in the 6<sup>th</sup> place and a binary value greater than 31, and are shown in all caps-bold.

These classifications of ascending and descending come from the observation that ascending hexagrams represent the movement from pure yin, 2䷁*~0~* ***Receptive***, to the maximum yang that can be supported before it can no longer be classified as ascending, or 43䷪*~31~* ***Breakthrough***. Likewise, descending hexagrams represent a pure yang state 1䷀*~63~* **CREATIVE**, to the minimum yin state that can be supported, 23䷖*~32~* **DISSOLUTION**.

The ascending accumulates yang and the descending disseminates yang. This is a concept that the King Wen authors must have also seen as it is evident in their interpretations that show:

- ***Ascending*** hexagrams represent processes that culminate in openness to transformation, alignment with larger forces, and acceptance of natural cycles. They emphasize receptivity, adaptation, and harmony with circumstances beyond personal control.

- **DESCENDING** hexagrams represent processes that culminate in assertion, definition, and extension of influence, and emphasize initiative, structure, and the application of will to shape circumstances.

For example, 46䷭*~6~* ***Pushing Upward*** represents the accumulation of yang through gradual, persistent effort of growth that succeeds through receptivity to natural cycles, like a plant pushing upward through soil, while its paired opposite, 25䷘*~57~* **INNOCENCE**, represents the dissemination of yang, spontaneous, natural action aligned with cosmic order, where one's inner integrity manifests as outer success through the power of acting without calculated intent.

In the most mundane and limited context, we can think of *Ascending* as the “cards you are dealt” in a game you are attempting to win at, and the **DESCENDING** as how you choose to play those cards that will bring you closer to your goal.

Tholonically speaking, the ascending hexagrams embody the principle of *Limitation*/*Definition* as they represent the contextual boundaries and natural cycles that define our scope of possibility and the larger forces beyond personal control that we must recognize and adapt to achieve sustainability. Conversely, the descending hexagrams embody the principle of Contribution/Integration as they represent how we actively contribute to our reality, and it’s limitations, through assertion, initiative, and the application of will to shape outcomes. This relationship creates a dynamic spectrum: ascending hexagrams establish the contextual limitations within which we operate, while descending hexagrams demonstrate how we integrate with and contribute to that context.

Just as Limitation and Contribution define the spectrum across which all negotiated states come into existence in the Tholonic model, these two complementary classes of hexagrams define the entire spectrum of possibilities that all 64 hexagrams represent, each showing a unique relationship between accepting the limitations of our context and actively contributing to it.

For reference, here is the list of all 32 pairs that represent the ascending and descending aspects of the parent concept, or “Path Name.”

<center><img src='../Images/32pairs-0.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

See the appendix for a more thorough analysis of the relationship between the polar and binary order.

Referring back to the circular star-chart, ***Fig. Star-1***, the first thing we notice is that the exact opposites of 2䷁*~0~* ***Receptive*** and 1䷀*~63~* **CREATIVE** begin and end the cycle at the top. Their opposite pair, at the bottom, is made up of the opposite hexagrams of 24䷗*~1~* the ***Return*** and 44䷫*~62~* **COMING TO MEET**. Considering this is exactly the point where the cycle begins to return, it suggests that the King Wen interpreters of the I Ching saw this same pattern.

We can also see that each pair of hexagrams for the same point has a meaning that is similar from two different aspects. In ***Fig. Star-2***, we have renamed these points according to the theme they share, or what we also refer to as the *path name*. Further on, we look at how this was arrived at.

The other thing we notice is the symmetry of the numbers, wherein every pair of opposite (ascending/descending) values on opposite sides of the vertical axis always equals 63, for example 25䷘*~57~* **INNOCENCE** and 46䷭*~6~* ***Pushing Upwards*** where 57 + 6 = 63. The same is true for every lower and upper trigram and their opposite equaling 7, but in the case of the ascending trigrams, the axis is diagonal from the lowest right sector to the highest left sector, and for the descending trigrams, the axis is mirrored, from lowest left to the highest right sector.

<img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/dot-circle-3a-2_axis.png" style='float:right;width:40%'/>These axes are not easily visualized, so here is a diagram, and, as we can see, the lower trigram connections follow crossed, diverging paths suggesting dynamism or tension, while the upper trigram connections form a more ordered, symmetrical geometric pattern suggesting stability and structure. This visual difference could represent the contrasting nature or functions of the upper and lower trigrams in I Ching philosophy, with lower trigrams potentially representing more dynamic, changing inner conditions and upper trigrams representing more structured, manifest outer conditions.  This is consistent with the concept that the lower trigrams is the more formative “inner” and the upper trigram is the more manifest “outer.”

Here is an overview of the cardinal pairs shown above, using the traditional King Wen hexagram titles and meanings

-   Pair 1)  1䷀*~63~* **CREATIVE** ⇔ 2䷁*~0~* ***Receptive***
-   - Both of these hexagrams define a genesis, the origin of creation, the primordial duality that forms the foundation of existence, where active creation and passive reception combine to give rise to all things.  This is where pure, dynamic force (CREATIVE) joins with the yielding, nurturing (Receptive), allowing creation to take form.  This polarity that defines the spectrum within which every other hexagrams exists.
      
    
-   Pair 2) 10䷉*~59~* **TREADING** ⇔ 7䷊*~11~* **Peace***
-   - Both of these describe a time when the high and the low are in **harmony**. In one case (*Peace*), a state of balance and harmonious coexistence , and in the other (TREADING), it is the result of decorum and when pleasant manners succeed in maintaining harmony and balance while navigating potential difficulties.
      
    
-   Pair 3) 13䷌*~61~* **FELLOWSHIP** ⇔ 19䷒*~3~* ***Approach***
-   - Both hexagrams speak of **connection**. In one case (*Approach*), there is the idea of coming closer, drawing near, or moving toward a goal or relationship, emphasizing building rapport or establishing presence. The other case (FELLOWSHIP) speaks of unity, communal effort, and forming bonds with others, emphasizing working together harmoniously.
      
    
-   Pair 4)  25䷘*~57~* **INNOCENCE** ⇔ 36䷣*~5~* ***Darkening of the Light***
-   - Both hexagrams refer to staying true to oneself and holding steadfast to one’s principles and **integrity**. finding the inner light for **guidance**. In one case (*Darkening*), enduring adversity while preserving one’s inner truth, maintaining integrity despite external suppression or hardship,  and in the other (INNOCENCE), acting with pure intention and maintaining authenticity, being aligned with natural virtue and unaffected by ulterior motives.
      
    
-   Pair 5) 44䷫*~62~* **COMING TO MEET** ⇔ 24䷗*~1~* ***Return***.
-   - Both hexagrams speak of a **reversing course**. In one case (*Return*), it is the natural turn of the cycle when the light returns to the darkness. In the other (COMING TO MEET), it is the result of a decision but warns one of allowing the inferior to gain access to the superior. However, it also admits that this meeting of “inferior” and “superior” is what brings about all life.
      
    
-   Pair 6) 6䷅*~58~* **CONFLICT** ⇔ 46䷭*~6~*  ***Pushing Upwards***
-   - Both hexagrams speak of **resolution** if progress is to succeed. In the one case (*Pushing Upward*), steady progress and advancement despite obstacles, emphasizing overcoming challenges with determination. In the other, (CONFLICT), speaks of struggles, disputes, and opposition, emphasizing the need to address and resolve differences.
      
    
-   Pair 7) 33䷠*~60~* **RETREAT** ⇔ 7䷆*~2~* ***Army***
-   - Both hexagrams speak of **strategy**. In one case (*Army*), an organized effort and disciplined action toward a goal, emphasizing strategic planning and collective force. In the other (RETREAT), withdrawing strategically to regroup or preserve strength, emphasizing calculated movement to avoid unnecessary conflict.
      
    
-   Pair 8) 12䷋*~56~* **STANDSTILL** ⇔ 15䷎*~4~* ***Modesty***.
-   - Both hexagrams describe a time of **restraint**. In one case (*Modesty*), humility and self-restraint, emphasizing the importance of not overreaching or asserting oneself excessively. In the other case (STANDSTILL), stagnation or blocked progress, emphasizing the need to remain calm and composed despite inactivity or obstacles.

These cardinal pairs can be reduced again to a more abstracted four pairs, and they can be reduced further to two, which would be the duality from which everything emerges. I argue here that this duality is the same duality that everything evolved from as well, that of *Definition* and *Contribution*, and everything exists as a result of *Negotiation* between those two states.  In this graph, all *Limitation/Definition* “green dot” words are green and the *Contribution/Integration* “red dot” words are red.  Uppercase have descending properties and lowercase have ascending properties, but keep in minds that we are attempting to show 4 generations of embedded ascending/descending and integrating/limiting properties, which is next to impossible in two dimensions.

<center><img src='../Images/revtree_v4.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

Although not shown here, applying this same reductionism to the 32 pairs result is a primal pair *Limitation/Definition* and *Contribution/Integration*, and to ensure objectivity in this process, all reductions were done by AI[^25] whose only input was the Wilhelm Bayes English translation of the I Ching and whose only request was to find the concept encompasses both child concepts.

## Understanding the Six Lines


There are not 6 lines in order to make 64 hexagrams; there are 64 hexagrams because there are 6 lines. The creators of the I Ching deliberately chose to use 6 lines because they knew that 6 is the minimum needed to create a complete archetype. Six represents the smallest complete structure that balances complexity and stability, reflecting mathematical perfection (as the first perfect number) and geometric integrity (as the edges of a tetrahedron). It forms the minimal set of binary interactions necessary to cover all dual possibilities, allowing for a dynamic interplay of yin and yang while maintaining structural balance and coherence. Hence, the six lines of a hexagram symbolize the progression from potential to fulfillment, capturing the full cycle of transformation and completeness inherent in an archetypal pattern, yet represented in the smallest possible model.

This is an idea that we see not only across many cultures all over the world, specifically in their stories of creation, but in science and geometry:

> -   The simplest three dimensional form requires 6 lines connecting 4 points (the tetrahedron).
>
> -   The Abrahamic traditions (i.e., Torah, Old Testament, Quran) say all of creation was accomplished in 6 days.
>
> -   The Babylonian creation myth, the Enuma Elis, where the one God created 6 gods, each in charge of the 6 different aspects of creation (where they spent 2 days creating everything and the rest of their days fighting with each other).
>
> -   The original Greek Titans were 6 men (Oceanus, Coeus, Crius, Hyperion, Iapetus, and Cronus), and their sisters, the Titanides (Theia, Rhea, Themis, Mnemosyne, Phoebe, and Tethys). They were all the children of the original 2 primordial gods, Uranus (primordial sky) and Gaia (primordial earth).
>
> -   In the building blocks of creation (chemistry) we see 6 electrons in carbon, the foundation of life.
>
> -   The archetype of the *N*-source, blue dot, from which all children emerge, has a value of 6, and its two children are 2 (*Definition*/*Limitation*) and 3 (*Contribution*/*Integration*).<img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/planisphere-nineveh-2.png" style='float:right;width:20%'/>

6 seems to be a very significant number and is firmly associated with the concept of creation. The utility of the number 6 is probably why the Sumerians invented a base-6 system, which we still use today (360°, 24 hours, 12 months), which they used to plot the stars with surprising accuracy, as we know from the *Planisphere of Nineveh* (right), and calculated values in the trillions (of what, we don’t know).

Below is a chart that shows a more in-depth description of the 6 steps from a tholonic and I Ching perspective. It is divided into two trigrams, *lower* and *upper*. Pay attention to the similarity of the three concepts that each line in the trigram shares with each other, as they are essentially mirror aspects of one another.

##### Note: It is both difficult and misleading to use one word to define an archetype that can have many different instances, nevertheless, we do exactly that, but remind the reader that these words are simply hints of a much larger significance.


<center><img src='../Images/line-desc-1.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

Once we cross the line from *lower* to the *upper*, the quality of the line positions flip, making what was **yang** in the *lower* trigram **yin** in the *upper* trigram, and vice versa. In the tholon, we see this same reversal in the children tholons, *reflection* triads, and *virtual* tholons.


<center><img src='../Images/line-desc-2.png' style='width:100%'/></center>

Here we equate the *upper* and *lower* trigrams of the I Ching to the three tholonic attributes of *N*, *D*, and *C*.


<center><img src='../Images/tho-table.png' style='width:80%'/></center>

Depending on the context (*upper* or *lower*), *N*, *D*, and *C* have slightly different expressions. In the most general sense, *N*, *D*, and *C* can represent many different concepts depending on their context.


<center><img src='../Images/tho-table-2.png' style='width:80%'/></center>

Because the I Ching is about the nature of unending change, it might serve us to view the stages of change as a continuous stream of change in the form of a wave, which we attempt to do in the image below

This continuity is consistent with the I Ching when it states: “*All movements are accomplished in six stages, and the seventh brings return.*” Here we see how the seventh stage returns us to the first stage of the next cycle. Another validation of using this waveform as a model is that the lower trigram of lines 1, 2, and 3 is, in fact, in the lower part of the waveform, and the upper trigram of 4, 5, and 6 is in the upper part.

This lower and upper assignment is not arbitrary; it is the result of the natural alignment of the dominant Yang line, which is position 5, being at the top, and the dominant Yin line, which is position 2, being at the bottom, and both aligned across the vertical axis.

On the right is a front view of the waveform that shows how the cycle is composed of six stages that alternate between yin (orange) and yang (blue). Within one complete cycle, we have highlighted the significant axis and their yin and yang properties. Using the archetypal yin/yang values for the six lines, we see that the upper half, being outward in nature, and the left half, being ascending in nature, are both yang. The lower half, being inner in nature, and the right half, being descending in nature, are both yin. This results in four quadrants that are, respectively, yin-yin (`00`<img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/bigram00.png" style='width:35px'/> or 0), yin-yang (`10`<img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/bigram01.png" style='width:35px'/> or 2), yang-yang (`11`<img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/bigram11.png" style='width:35px'/> or 3), and yang-yin (`01`<img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/bc/bigram01.png" style='width:35px'/> or 1), which are shown in each corner as bigrams.

It might seem odd that the cycle starts at the 4:00 position on the circular chart, and not the 6:00 or 12:00 position, but the positions of the lines were determined by their yin/yang qualities. The vertical axis is the only axis that aligns with the 6 axes of the lines, and as line 2 is a yin line within a yin hemisphere, it naturally represents the nadir. The same is true for its opposite, line 5.

Interesting side note: in Christian monasticism, traditional Chinese medicine, some military and agricultural traditions, and even human hormonal cycles, 4:00 AM is considered the start of a new day, just as the yin cycle flips to a yang cycle at 4:00, making the final yin stage a perfect correlate to the Medieval folklore and Christian traditions that “devil’s hour” ends at 4:00 AM.

## The Form of Hexagrams


We can easily recognize this same archetypal structure of the I Ching and the tholon in many systems, from the process of mitosis to the shape of trees and plants with their *inner* roots and *outer* branches and leaves. This is significant because in the thologram there is a similar concept with a real tholon and a virtual tholon which are matched to create a complete tholon. We also saw an example of this in the book “THOLONIA - The Mechanics of Existential Awareness” when looking at how the complete tholon models quarks to the proton.

In the thologram, all odd-numbered tholons are *real* and all even-numbered tholons are *virtual*. Likewise, all hexagrams that begin with a yin line are even-numbered hexagrams, and those that begin with a yang line are odd-numbered. We now have a very clean mapping between the thologram and the I Ching of *virtual* as yin and *real* as yang.

We arrived at the same results of 6 fundamental concepts formed by a pair of triads from two completely different processes: the process of the thologram was based on creating a tetrahedron from a point, while the I Ching is based solely on the binary system.

There are many mappings and similarities between the tholon and the I Ching, but I will only show one more because it not only maps hexagrams to tholons but to basic physical structures in nature

<img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/overlay-gen.png" style='float:right;width:50%'/>If we create a binary tree of the I Ching where the bifurcations follow the path of least resistance, meaning they will always move into the emptiest space, we end up with bifurcations separated by 60° (which is also the angle that creates a tetrahedron/tholon). This would then create the patterns (right) for each of the 6 generations of bifurcations.

Simply splitting one line into two lines, in accordance with the laws of laws of least energy, we naturally form a pattern of hexagons that matches the pattern of tholonic expansion. This is because the I Ching and the thologram represent the same laws but in the context of a binary system (I Ching) and a trinary or synergetic system (thologram). Not surprisingly, the one point they both naturally center around is the *N*-source.

The image below is a more in-depth version showing the expansion of the I Ching’s lines from 1 to 6, and beyond. In this image, we follow each bifurcation starting with the one point from which the original duality emerged. The arrows show the direction of the movement, with left-sided (or *port* side, as the side is relative to the direction of the arrow) arrows as yin and right-sided (or *starboard* side) arrows as yang (or vice versa). Doubled-headed arrows indicate that one line (in the same direction) is shared by two parents, and lines with arrows in both directions indicate a shared line that is bidirectional.

***Fig. hb1*** shows the paths of all 64 hexagrams of the I Ching which are the result of 6 generations. ***Fig hb2*** shows the 7th generation. This is added only to show that with the 7th generations we get the first complete closure of a hexagram (the first one, in the center), which is another example of the “*All movements are accomplished in six stages, and the **seventh** brings return*”. ***Fig hb3*** is the same pattern, but iterated over 13 generations, generating 8,192 (or 2<sup>13</sup>) final values. It is included simply to show how the larger form remains a hexagram and how only the last two generations (purple and cyan) are even visible, occluding all previous generations. Notice how at this point, the dominant pattern, which will remain the dominant pattern for all future children, are two sets of three double-headed arrows, one set from the final generation (right), and one from the previous generation (left), shown in this image<img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/triplet-pairs.png" style='width:30px'/>pattern of 2×3 (final generations × intersections of movement) does not appear until the 2<sup>3</sup> (or 8<sup>th</sup>) generation. Because new generations overlap the previous when shown in two dimensions, we can’t see that this is really more of a 3D design, with the originating point in the center, expanding with each generation, creating a hexagonal cone.

This pattern of 6 triangles also happens to be two tetrahedrons that perfectly describe the shape of the thologram, i.e., two tholons, one *real* and one *virtual*, connected at the base. Yes, this is purely the result of the properties of geometry, but as the I Ching ands the thologram are built upon the same laws, we would expect to see such interrelated patterns.

Also of interest in this diagram is how it shows that the original *N*-source is the result of its own creation *after* 6 generations. In other words, after 6 generations, a new *N*-source is created in the same location as the original *N*-source, creating a new cycle that *departs* from the previous. Notice that it is the 5<sup>th</sup> place where two different cycles come together for the first time, which is why the 5<sup>th</sup> place is one of *integration*.

All of this is to demonstrate how the two systems are quite compatible to the point where not only can the entire I Ching be mapped to the thologram, but the thologram can greatly elaborate on the I Ching and give it a 3D structure, and given its recursive nature, infinitely so.
