# I: Foundations of the Tholonic I Ching

## Bridging Ancient Wisdom and Universal Patterns


This exploration aims to examine the ancient wisdom of the I Ching through the lens of the Tholonic model, demonstrating not only how this 5,000-year-old system of divination and philosophy aligns with modern understandings of energy, consciousness, and creation, but how it can expand upon and explain the Tholonic model, and vice versa as well. By examining the I Ching’s fundamental concepts of yin and yang, trigrams, and hexagrams within the framework of tholonic principles, we can bridge ancient Eastern wisdom with contemporary Western thought, revealing the universal patterns that underlie all systems of knowledge and existence, which are foundational to the Tholonic model.



## Why Choose the I Ching?


The Tholonic model is compatible with virtually all conceptual models of reality and creation, so why did we single out the choice of the I Ching?

 *Accessibility:* The *I Ching* is one of the oldest, accessible, and practical models of the creative process available.

*Quantifiable Properties:* Its structured system of hexagrams and lines provides quantifiable properties that make it easy to compare with the Tholonic Model.

*Historical Significance:* With thousands of years of use and study, the *I Ching* offers a deep well of knowledge for comparative analysis.

*Extensive Commentary:* Its rich body of commentary and interpretations adds depth and context, making it an excellent reference point.

*Cross-Disciplinary and cross-cultural acceptance:* The I Ching is recognized worldwide, influencing philosophy, religion, art, literature, science, technology, and medicine across Western, Jewish, Islamic, Asian, and East Asian cultures. Its principles are studied at leading universities such as Oxford, Cambridge, Columbia, and Stanford.

Additionally, the I Ching shares and predates core principles with several major belief systems, such as Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism, Kabbalah, Hermeticism, Indigenous Wisdom Traditions, Sufism, Judaism, Islam, and Christianity, particularly their emphasis on *balance* and the interplay of opposites, *cyclical transformation* and growth, and the *interconnectedness* of all things.

The Tholonic model and the I Ching also share the axiomatic and quite common principle that everything emerges from and exists within a duality, with the identical intention. While the Tholonic model describes an all-encompassing three-dimensional holarchy of all that can exist in the form of a fractal tetrahedral matrix, the 5,000-year-old legendary and mythical ruler *Fu Xi* (~2700 BCE)) Created the I Ching to *“become thoroughly conversant with the numinous and bright and to classify the myriad things.”*



## Essential Tholonic Terminology

### Yin Yang: The Fundamental Duality


Most people have some concept of what *yin* and *yang* represent, but for clarification, we’ll reiterate: sometimes the words “positive” and “negative,” or the symbols “+” and “-,” are used to represent yang and yin, but this concept is woefully insufficient to represent their true multidimensional complexity. Here are some traditional examples of yin and yang qualities that will help you get a feel for what they mean if you are not already familiar with them: **Yin**: dark, night, winter, moon, female, cold, water, alkaline, patience, to be, to rest, single-tasking, de-flamed, soothed, holistic, university of life, letting go, death, disease, emotion, not being, uncertainty, chaos, illogical, heart-based feelings. **Yang**: light, day, summer, sun, male, hot, fire, acid, impetuosity, action, multi-tasking, inflammation, burnout, allopathy, academia, control, life, health, to be, certainty, order, logic.

More importantly, the concepts of yin and yang are relative. For example, “to be” exists in both categories, as “being” can be yin and/or yang, just as water is yang to earth and yin to fire. Like everything, the perception of properties is relative to the context and scope of its existence and application.



### Holon and Parton: Components of Existence


<img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/0_001.png" style='float:right;width:30%'/>A holon is sustainable and stable system, process, or concept that has a clear definition, and a parton are the contributing components that allow for that holon to exist and helps define the form am function of the holon.

A cell is a holon, but as a liver cell, is is a parton to the holon of the liver, just as the cell’s nucleus, mitochondria, and membrane are partons to the holon of the cell

Holons and partons combine to form self-organizing networks of interactions and relationships called a *holarchy*.[^15]

### NDC: Negotiation, Definition, and Contribution


*NDC* stands for *Negotiation-Definition-Contribution*, also known as *balance-limitation-integration*. In the Tholonic model, this trinity of interactions form the foundation of all existence:

**Negotiation (Balance):** This represents the process of balancing or achieving equilibrium between interacting forces. Depending on context, it can act as a verb (the *act* of balancing or negotiating) or as a noun (the *state* of having achieved balance or becoming negotiated). In diagrams presented in this book, this  *Negotiation* concept is represented as a *blue* dot, and acts acts as an initiating point, also called an *N*-state.

**Definition (Limitation):** This refers to the restrictions or boundaries that shape any creation, whether material (available physical resources), energetic (available energy), or structural (contextual constraints like sustainability, time, or space). In our diagrams, this is represented as a *green* dot.

**Contribution (Integration/Interaction):** This represents what a process returns to the environment it was created.  Contributions can take many forms, such as interactions, material resources, ideas, or any effect that influences the system it exists in and interacts with. In our diagrams, this is represented as a *red* dot.

<img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/0_006.png" style='float:right;width:100%'/>

Within the Tholonic model, the *NDC* trinity describes the core dynamic that allows systems to emerge, sustain themselves, and interact with their surroundings. In our diagrams, the emergent property that results from the interaction of *NDC* is typically represented as a *yellow* dot in two-dimensional maps, or a *white* dot in three-dimensional maps, depending on the context and can also act as an *n-child* or *n-state*.

The image below illustrates a simple example comparing a 3D map and a 2D map representing the same concept. The Gaussian curve at the base of the 2D map shows how Limitation (D) and Integration (C) interact to form a spectrum of possible outcomes. New child instances are most likely to emerge near the center of this spectrum, where there is an optimal balance between Limitation and Integration.

<img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/4forces-tetra_v3.png" style='width:80%'/>

Here we see a potential problem;  How can the yellow dot on the 2D map be considered equivalent to the white dot on the 3D tetrahedron when they appear in different positions, with the yellow dot on the <u>*CD*</u> spectrum and the white dot as a separate fourth point?

The yellow dot on the 2D map and the white dot on the 3D tetrahedron represent the same emergent point, but the difference in placement is due to dimensional compression. The yellow dot's position on the 2D map signifies the optimal equilibrium point where emergence is most likely, maintaining conceptual compatibility despite dimensional reduction.

The relationships on the 2D map are simpler and more linear compared to those on the 3D map. The 2D map primarily represents a balance between two opposing forces or concepts (contribution and limitation), with the yellow dot positioned as a midpoint along the spectrum. This straightforward relationship makes the 2D map a useful shorthand for visualizing balance and emergence. In contrast, the 3D tetrahedron involves more complex interactions because it integrates three interconnected vertices (negotiation, contribution, and limitation) converging at a fourth point, representing a balanced culmination. The 3D representation captures the nuanced interplay between all three forces simultaneously, while the 2D map distills this complexity into a simplified projection that focuses on the most prominent balance.



### N-child or n-state: Emergence and Recursion


An *N-child* or *n-state* (with a lowercase “n”) refers to a new sustainable point that emerges from the children of an *N*-state (with an uppercase “*N*”) as a result of the system’s *NDC* interactions. This new creation inherits the structure and properties of its parent *N*-state but develops its unique identity. The term *N*-state typically refers to the parent (blue) point, and *n-state* or *n-child* refers to the child point (yellow or white) depending on what aspects of the child is being referred to.

Due to the recursive nature of the *thologram*, these *n-states* can evolve into *N-states* when they mature into stable systems capable of generating their own *n-states*, continuing the cycle of creation.



### Tholon: The Tetrahedral Building Block


A *tholon* is a specific type of holon within the Tholonic model that is represented as a tetrahedral unit composed of a central concept, representing a *Negotiated* state, or *N*-state (blue dot), and two partons, representing *Defining* properties (red dot) and a *Contributing* properties (green dot), interacting to produce an emergent outcome (white/yellow dot). These four points, when presented in 3D, form the tetrahedral structure of a *tholon*. Think of the *tholon* as a building block of reality, similar to how an atom represent the sustainable state of atomic equilibrium defined by its quantum and structural limitations which determines its ability to interact and form new stable structures, or any structure with its specific form and function.

There is also the concept of a *virtual* *tholon*. This occurs when the multi-generational self-similar 2D triangular grid collapses into a 3D tetrahedral matrix, or *thologram*.  In such a matrix, all tetrahedrons on the odd-numbered generations are orthoscopic, or front-facing, while even-numbered generations collapse to the pseudoscopic, or rear-facing. We refer to the front-facing tholons as *real* *tholons* and the back-facing *tholons* as *virtual* *tholons* or *reflection* *tholons*. This means that the child *tholon* is always the opposite of the parent.  *Real tholons* can exist with *virtual tholons*, and vise versa.



### Thologram: The Recursive Structure of Creation


These tetrahedral matrices form the *thologram* is a self-organizing, self-similar, recursive tetrahedral matrix that represents the structure that serves as a universal framework that applies to all forms of creation, whether abstract, such as theories, beliefs, and ideas, or material, such as galaxies, organisms, and ecosystems. Through its recursive nature, the thologram illustrates how patterns of creation repeat and evolve across different scales and contexts, reflecting the interconnected and self-organizing nature of existence.

## Awareness & Intention: Source of Energy and Existence

### Thought Experiment: The Zero-Dimensional Point


To best understand the basic premise of the Tholonic model, let’s use a thought experiment.

Imagine a zero-dimensional point within an infinite void of nothingness. It exists only as a concept, without form, dimensions, or measurable properties. Its existence depends entirely on your awareness of it.

Hold this concept of a 0D point in your mind.

A core principle of the Tholonic model is that everything created inherits the attributes and limitations of its creator, albeit subject to the influence of the environment. We find this same concept in many arenas, such as philosophy, metaphysics, and science. It suggests that every creation carries an imprint of its origin, shaped by the nature, constraints, and intention of its source. It’s the basic concept behind why plants create plants, not cats or sneakers. In this case, where we have a conceptual point in a void of nothingness, there is no environment, and our 0D point, being only a concept, doesn’t even exist outside of a concept in your mind. However, given that our 0D point is an instance of *awareness*, i.e., a concept, we can say that this point, being a creation of awareness, has the property of *awareness*. Not only that, it must also have the property of *intention*, given that the awareness that conceived it did so with the intent to conceive it. In the Tholonic model, awareness and intention always exist together, as one cannot exist without the other.

Of course, it’s difficult to imagine our conceptual point as having its own awareness or intentions. However, if you possessed infinite awareness and focused all of your intention onto a zero-dimensional point, you would create a singularity of awareness, representing infinite potential concentrated into absolute and minimal definition.

According to the Tholonic model, this would result in:

- **Negotiation (Balance):** Infinite awareness condensed into a perfectly balanced state—an equilibrium between everything and nothing, potential and actuality, chaos and order.

- **Definition (Limitation):** By narrowing infinite awareness down to a single, dimensionless concept, you impose the greatest possible limitation, reducing infinite possibilities to absolute singularity. Paradoxically, this limitation creates a gateway back into infinite potential.

- **Contribution (Integration):** This singular point becomes the ultimate seed for manifestation. It inherently demands emergence because infinite potential naturally seeks expression. The precise act of defining this point sets the stage for creative expansion, inevitably leading to the generation of new realities, dimensions, or universes from this intense concentration of awareness.

It may initially seem strange or counterintuitive to suggest that a concept possesses its own limited form of awareness and intention. Typically, we view concepts as passive constructs created by human awareness. However, from the Tholonic perspective, awareness and intention are not separate phenomena. Instead, they are two perspectives or expressions of a single, underlying principle, much like electricity and magnetism or form and function; one reality perceived from two complementary angles, depending on the context.

This unified principle represents a fundamental and omnipresent force from which our entire reality evolves, echoing panpsychic views in which consciousness permeates all existence, with individual instances of awareness emerging from this universal field. Even a simple concept can therefore embody this principle in a limited form. A concept maintains its boundaries (definition) and interacts meaningfully with other concepts (contribution), demonstrating what can be perceived as intention. At the same time, it continuously responds and adapts to interactions, thereby exhibiting a primitive form of awareness.

Thus, rather than being consciously deliberate, a concept’s awareness and intention are implicit expressions of a universal, underlying force that drives the coherence, definition, and integration of all forms within reality.

Following this reasoning, if a point exists as a concept with awareness and intention, then its only natural action is to create another point, just as it was created. This is not arbitrary but a fundamental principle of *creation begets creation*, illustrating the recursive nature of A&I embedding itself into its manifestations.  This first act of creation therefore unfolds into the next, and the next, and so on.

Thus, what initially appeared as an unusual assertion, that a concept inherently possesses awareness and intention, is revealed, upon deeper reflection, as an inevitable truth. Furthermore, the first manifestation of this truth naturally emerges as a duality, elegantly exemplified by fundamental concepts like yin and yang or the binary pairing of 0 and 1, the simplest representation of the simplest duality; *nothing* and *something*.



## The Taijitu: Manifesting Duality and Creation


With this in mind, let’s reflect on the foundational principle of the I Ching: the polarity of yin and yang. Although this duality predates Taoism, the Taoist symbol of Yin and Yang (the *Taijitu*) visually embodies this essential concept. Remarkably, we recognize this same fundamental pattern echoed in nature itself, as shown in the striking similarity between the *Taijitu* and the cosmic microwave background radiation, an archetypal imprint of the immense energy released at the birth of our universe in the Big Bang.[^16]:


<center><img src='../Images/ic_yinyang.png' style='width:50%'/></center>

[^16]: **Delabrouille, Jacques.** *PSM Project: Planck Sky Model.* Université Paris Cité. Available at: https://apc.u-paris.fr/~delabrou/PSM/psm.html

This Taoist *Taijitu* symbol represents the duality that emerged from the oneness or monism of our 0D point (*blue-dot* or *N*-state), creating itself. The ancient *Tao Te Ching*[^27], written by Lao Tzu (~600 BCE), the founder of Taoism, explains quite simply and clearly how this progression advances:

*The Tao gives birth to One.* *One gives birth to Two.* *Two gives birth to Three.* *Three gives birth to the ten thousand things.*

[^27]: **Lao Tzu (trans. D.C. Lau).** *Tao Te Ching.* Penguin Classics, 1963

The initial duality emerging from the "One" occurs when the original 0D point inevitably creates another 0D point. This act of creation naturally happens because the original blue dot has no limitations or attributes other than its inherent awareness and intention, compelling it to replicate itself.  The first 0D point is equivalent to our *Negotiated* state of the blue dot, or *N*-state, and the second 0D point is the introduction of limitations, for without this green dot, the blue dot was unlimited, in a void of nothingness.  there is nothing out green dot, which is the

In our unthinkable thought experiment, the existence of a zero-dimensional point in nothingness might be considered a duality, that of the somethingness of a conceptual point and nothingness, but the nothingness itself did not exist as a concept prior to the appearance of the point. Strictly speaking, a conceptual point in nothingness is just a conceptual point. There is no duality, just the monism of the concept. So, while we can say that somethingness and nothingness, referring to the primal dot and the void it exists within, are the first duality, the fact that there is a concept of nothing proves this is inaccurate because the concept of nothing is itself something.

The more accurate description would be the duality of “Is” and “Is Not,” referring to the blue and green dot, because the creation of the green dot is the first instance of that which “Is Not” the blue dot, and the blue dot is the first instance of that which “Is”, which has no concept of that which “is not” if it is the only “is” in existence.

It might be a bit pedantic to argue the difference between *Is/Is Not* versus *somethingness/nothingness*, but that difference turns out to play a very critical role in the Tholonic model because the concept of nothingness is not at all a limiting concept. On the contrary, it represents absolute, the unlimited freedom with no limitation, while the concept of *Is Not* is essentially the archetype of limitation.

The Taijitu represents the duality that brings forth the “*ten thousand things*”.  We say this because, tholonically, the Taijitu is described as 1 tholon with 2 partons, each of those having 2 partons.  This creates 7 tholons over 3 generations <img src="/home/jw/src/iching_cli/book/intro/Images/Taijitu-tholons_2.png" style='float:right;width:50%'/>that self-organize along the paths of least resistance to form an array that can be described by 3 hexagrams formed by 6 triangles.  Here, the Taijitu is yellow *n-state*, not a blue *N*-state, because it is the first child of the parent *N*-state, whiuch created the . This diagram shows clearly that the Taijitu is created by the joining of yin and yang, rather than being the creator so yin and yang.

What is significant here is that the I Ching’s Taijitu is the first *n-state* in the thologram, with the primary *N*-state being the “One” created by the Tao, the Awareness and Intention of creation. The only difference is that the Taijitu shows a dynamic of change, or negotiating (mixing), while the *n-state* represents a negotiated state (i.e., mixed red and green, yellow).


<center><img src='../Images/0_007.png' style='width:80%'/></center>

While one might initially assume *Awareness* and *Intention* constitute the first duality, practically speaking, they are not truly separate because neither can exist independently of the other. Instead, they represent two complementary perspectives of a single unified phenomenon, analogous to wave-particle duality in physics, where one underlying reality is perceived differently depending on context. In this unified view, awareness is the recognition of existence, and intention is the purposeful movement within that recognition; inseparable aspects of the fundamental process of conscious creation, neither of which can exist alone.

Rather than a duality, they form a self-referential singularity, where one perspective reveals awareness as the receptive aspect of existence, and the other reveals intention as its active counterpart. Awareness and intention are fundamentally one, appearing distinct only when expressed through a dualistic framework, the structure that enables differentiation.

The singularity itself does not split into awareness and intention; instead, differentiation emerges within an existing duality, giving rise to these aspects as distinct expressions. In this sense, duality is not created by the singularity but serves as its medium of manifestation, while the singularity itself remains whole and undivided. This medium arises through the singularity’s self-instantiation when the zero-dimensional dot creates a second dot and the first act of differentiation.

We can understand this through the linguistic concept of "I Am," where "I" represents the most basic expression of awareness—an identifying label for the self. However, as a noun, it is merely a passive designation. In contrast, "Am" is a verb that signifies the action of being, an active assertion of existence. Together, these two elements, the passive "I" and the active "Am", form the most fundamental declaration of identity and existence.

This mirrors the relationship between *awareness* and *intention* in the Tholonic model. Just as "I" passively denotes the presence of self-awareness, awareness itself represents the fundamental recognition of existence. Meanwhile, "Am" actively asserts being, paralleling *intention* as the dynamic force that drives expression and manifestation. In this way, "I Am" encapsulates the dual perspective of a singular principle of awareness as recognition and intention as the active force of becoming, perfectly aligning with the concept of a unified phenomenon perceived from two complementary angles.

Interestingly, this concept resonates with the biblical account where God revealed His name to Moses as "I Am" (in Hebrew, *Ehyeh Asher Ehyeh*, often translated as "I Am That I Am") in the Book of Exodus. This divine self-identification emphasizes pure existence and awareness as the source of all that is.

The conceptual parallels between the Tholonic model and traditions such as Taoist philosophy, Hermetic principles, and various mystical systems are striking. While these similarities might suggest the Tholonic model borrowed from these traditions, it was actually developed through an attempt to apply first principles reasoning to fundamental questions about the nature of energy—beyond just how energy behaves or can be measured.

Modern science excels at describing energy's properties and transformations through frameworks like quantum field theory and thermodynamics. However, science often treats the ultimate question of what energy fundamentally is as outside its domain, categorizing it as metaphysical or philosophical. The Tholonic model attempts to bridge this gap.

Science has made remarkable progress through empirical measurement and mathematical modeling, but faces inherent limitations when addressing phenomena that resist conventional measurement or exist beyond our current instrumentation capabilities. These limitations become especially apparent when considering propositions that challenge scientific materialism, such as the possibility that consciousness or awareness might be fundamental aspects of reality rather than emergent properties, or that seemingly inanimate matter might possess forms of proto-awareness.

The Tholonic model's convergence with ancient wisdom traditions may reflect that both approaches are grappling with the same underlying reality, albeit through different methodological lenses.



## Core Interactions of Existence: Practical Examples


In the Tholonic framework, all forms of existence are shaped by three fundamental interactions: negotiation, definition, and contribution. These forces influence every action, relationship, interaction, and transformation, whether referring to conceptual points in a void or galaxies and atoms.

In the context of our material reality, we see these three properties as: Work → Force → Distance, Pressure → Area → Force, Momentum → Mass → Velocity, Power → Voltage → Current, Wavelength → Frequency → Speed, Charge → Electric Field → Force, Temperature → Volume → Pressure, Stress → Strain → Elasticity, Density → Mass → Volume, Friction → Surface Roughness → Force, and many more.

*Work, Pressure, Momentum, Power, Wavelength, Charge, Temperature, Stress, Density, Friction*

- These properties are **Negotiation**-related because they all describe how different forces, energies, or influences balance and interact within a system to produce a resultant state or effect. They reflect the principle that stability and existence emerge from dynamic interplay, where contrasting or complementary elements find equilibrium or harmonize to sustain patterns or states.

*Force, Area, Mass, Voltage, Frequency, Electric Field, Volume, Strain, Mass, Surface Roughness*

- These properties represent **Limitation** or **Definition** because they set boundaries or constraints that shape how negotiation processes unfold. They act as limiting factors that determine the extent, intensity, or capacity of interactions within a system, defining how much force, area, mass, voltage, frequency, electric field, volume, strain, or surface roughness can influence the final outcome.

*Distance, Force, Velocity, Current, Speed, Force, Pressure, Elasticity, Volume, Force*

- These properties are associated with **Contribution** or **Integration** because they represent the final outcome or effect resulting from the interaction of negotiation and limitation factors. They manifest as the tangible or measurable result of balanced dynamics within a system, integrating the influences of previous processes into a coherent and stable state.

Some practical examples are:

**Newton’s Second Law of Motion**: In *F=ma*, *Force* maps to negotiation (balance) as the interaction that drives change, *mass* maps to limitation (definition) as the resistance or boundary that shapes the interaction, and *acceleration* maps to contribution (integration) as the resulting effect or output of the system.

**Theory of Special Relativity:** In *E = mc²*, *speed of light squared* (*C²*) maps to negotiation (balance) as the transformational factor that governs the interaction between mass and energy, *mass* (*M*) maps to limitation (definition) as the fundamental constraint or structure, and *energy* (*E*) maps to contribution (integration) as the resulting effect or emergent property.

**Ohm’s Law**: In *V=IR*, *Volts* (*V*) map to negotiation (balance) as the driving potential that enables interaction, *resistance* (*R*) maps to limitation (definition) as the resistance that constrains the flow, and *amps* (*I*) map to contribution (integration) as the resulting current that flows through the system.

**Atomic Theory**: *Neutrons* map to negotiation (balance) as they stabilize the atom without carrying charge, *protons* map to limitation (definition) as they define the atomic identity through positive charge and structure, and *electrons* map to contribution (integration) as they facilitate interactions, bonding, and energy exchange within and between atoms.

**Chaos, Order, Emergence[^14]**: *Chaos* maps to negotiation (balance) as the dynamic field of possibilities seeking equilibrium, *order* maps to limitation (definition) as the structured constraints that shape and stabilize interactions, and *emergence* maps to contribution (integration) as the resulting patterns, structures, or phenomena that arise from their interplay.

**Quantum Mechanics**: In quarks, *color charge* maps to negotiation (balance) as quarks must achieve a stable, color-neutral state, *flavor* maps to limitation (definition) as it determines the identity and role of each quark, and *strong interaction* (gluon exchange) maps to contribution (integration) as it binds quarks together to form stable particles.

 In the context of human paradigms and methods, we observe this model consistently applied:
